# Federal Register / Vol. 81, No. 194/Thursday, October 6, 2016/Rules and Regulations

## control crayfish, maintain habitat conditions by removing excess vegetation, and inform the public about the species, and inform the public about NPS and BLM authorities and regulatory mechanisms have successfully provided or facilitated conservation of the species (see "Conservation Actions Implemented" above). NPS, BLM, BR, and the Service are signatory to the Conservation Agreement and actively involved in all actions of the Conservation Team. Each agency coordinates development of annual work plans and utilizes their authority to implement and provide resources for the actions that benefit the species. Federal authorities and regulatory mechanisms have successfully provided or facilitated conservation of the species. We did not find any stressors examined under the Act's threat factors A, B, C, and E that would rise to the level of determining the continued listing of the relict leopard frog is warranted. Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the status of the species, we find that the Act's five factors for listing the relict leopard frog are not currently impacting the relict leopard frog and its habitat. Regarding cumulative effects, there are potential synergistic effects that may act together to affect relict leopard frogs at certain sites. Overgrowth of vegetation, disease acting on small populations may concurrently, Flash floods or wildfire may adversely affect a site and the predators. Reduced habitat with connectivity adversely affected by roads and other human-made structures may as well. Populations due to predation and reduced habitat with connectivity adversely affected by roads and other human-made structures may as well. Populations due reduced habitat with connectivity adversely affected by roads and other human-made structures may as well. Populations of relict leopard frogs are affected by overgrowth of plants and predators. Climate change may affect a site at the same time as grazing, wildfire, and flash floods. However, after evaluating the cumulative effects, we conclude that the magnitude of the relict leopard frog is low to moderate. Most stressors in the relict leopard frog's relatively isolated geographic areas due to the isolated distribution of most sites. Although individual effects may be affected by geographic area, there would not be population level effects to the species. Multiple stressors on relict leopard frogs may act synergistically, especially when combined with the beneficial effects that various conservation efforts and regulatory mechanisms have provided to the species. We find that the stressors combined with the beneficial effects that the various conservation efforts and regulatory mechanisms have provided to the species, we find that the stressors currently impacting the relict leopard frog and its habitat are not regarded as cumulative. Therefore, we do not consider the relict leopard frog to be threatened or endangered by any combination of the stressors.

## presence of nonnative plants can make the effects of excess vegetation worse. Overgrowth of vegetation may reduce habitat for breeding populations smaller, such as bullfrogs and small populations smaller. Disease and predation may also exacerbate the effects of small populations determined by the removing of frogs. We determined that they are affected to may occur, although they are not expected to be widespread. Most individual stressors magnitude. Most individual stressors adversely affect the relict leopard frog in a single geographic area, due to the isolated distribution of most sites. Allopatric distribution is most affected by synergistic effects in a single geographic area, then the effects would not be minimized or mitigated to species. To minimize or mitigate effects from stressors affecting the relict leopard frog, the Conservation Population Teams will continue the monitoring population and reintroducing frogs to sites in which they are becoming greatly reduced. Extripated due to the effects of one or more stressors.

## Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the status of the species, and the Act's five threat factors, we find that the Act's five threat factors, we find that the Act's five threat factors, we find the relict leopard frog is not threatened or endangered throughout all of its range. We therefore conducted an analysis to determine if it was endangered or threatened throughout a significant portion of its range. To do this, we evaluated whether there was any portion of the species' range where threats were concentrated such

## that the species in that portion would be endangered or threatened, and that losing that portion of the range would be detrimental to the remainder of the species. Once we endangered or threatened. No geographic concentration of threats that would cause a greater risk of extinction, then we could conclude that no portion warranted further consideration. Therefore, we find listing the relict leopard frog as an endangered or threatened species throughout all of a significant portion of its range under the Act is not warranted at this time, and consequently we are removing it from candidate status. As a result of the Service's 2011 multi-year work plan for biological settlement with the WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (81 FR 49670). Litigation No. 10-377 (D.C. Cir.), MDL Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C.), 2011), for all 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service's 2010 annual candidate review (75 FR 78170), November 10, 2010. This document satisfies the requirements of the settlement agreement for the relict leopard frog, and constitutes the Service's 12-month finding on the May 8, 2002, petition to list the relict leopard frog as an endangered or threatened species. An endangered or threatened species basis for this finding, including the many effective conservation measures completed by the Conservation Team, can be found in the relict leopard frog's species report, and other supporting documents (see ADDRESSES above).

## Sicklefin Redhorse Sucker (Catostomus wigginsi) (hereafter referred to as Sicklefin Redhorse Sucker)

## Previous Federal Actions

The sicklefin redhorse sucker was originally made a candidate on May 11, 2005 (70 FR 28740), and it was included in the September 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 78170), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57822), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 63760), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), December 22, 2013 (78 FR 74014), and November 25, 2014 (79 FR 72450). On April 20, 2010, we received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity, requesting that the Service list 404 aquatic species as endangered or threatened species under the Act.
