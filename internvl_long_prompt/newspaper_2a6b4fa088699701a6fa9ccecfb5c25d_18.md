## Supplemental Information
NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.

The 2016 flathead sole and yellowfin sole CDQ reserves specified in the BSAI are 5,719 metric tons (mt) and 5,472 mt, respectively. The final 2016 and 2017 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (81 FR 14773, March 18, 2016) and following revision (81 FR 64782, September 21, 2016) established the ABC reserves for flathead sole and yellowfin sole as 5,472 mt and 5,719 mt, respectively. The Community Development Quota (CDQ) ABC reserves are 5,472 mt and 5,719 mt, respectively.

The Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association has requested that NMFS exchange 80 mt of flathead sole CDQ reserves for 80 mt of yellowfin sole CDQ reserves under §679.31(d). Therefore, in exchange for 80 mt of yellowfin sole CDQ reserves, NMFS reserves for 80 mt of yellowfin sole CDQ reserves for the Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association (API) and the following revision (81 FR 64782, September 21, 2016), are revised as follows:
