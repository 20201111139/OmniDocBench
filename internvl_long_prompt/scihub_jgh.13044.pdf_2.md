*P values were calculated by the means of Student t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, or chi-square test.

†Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation, median (interquartile range), or number (percentage).

‡Obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 28.

§Hypertension was defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg at least two measurements, or a previous diagnosis of hypertension by a clinician or self-reported current use of anti-hypertensive medication.

¶Hyperglycemia was defined as FPG ≥ 6.1 mmol/L.

## Discussion

Compared with the subjects born in the non-exposed group, the odds ratio for obesity of the subjects born in 1961 was increased by 38.4% (95% CI: 1.101-1.738) after adjustment of age and sex. The odds ratios of being hyperglycemia are significantly higher in the subjects born in 1960 (1.293 times, 95% CI: 1.041-1.605), 1961 (1.321 times, 95% CI: 1.073-1.626), and 1962 (1.362 times, 95% CI: 1.156-1.604) than the non-exposed group. No positive association of Chinese famine on hypertension among total study population.

Although there is strong evidence from animal models that maternal nutritional status during pregnancy can induce permanent changes in the fetus, it is still not clear how this might apply to human populations. Our study adds to the literature on the effects of famine exposure in developing countries. In the present ecological study, we have found that exposure to the Chinese famine during fetal life and infancy was associated with a marginally higher risk of hyperglycemia among subjects according to the Chinese famine.
