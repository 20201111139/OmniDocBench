Mrs. Wilson added everything up. Her children were right. "Well done," she said. "Next time we'll do the shopping nearby."

1. The things at the corner store were ______ than those in the supermarket.
   A. cheaper
   B. nicer
   C. more expensive
   D. better

2. Mrs. Wilson ______ in the end.
   A. spent more money
   B. paid less money
   C. lost some money
   D. saved a little money

These two questions are both multiple-choice questions, but they cannot be directly selected from the text to get the answer. We need to analyze and calculate the answer. (1) C. By Mrs. Wilson's words "Because they are cheaper here than at the corner store near our home." we can know that the things at the corner store were more expensive. (2) A. Mrs. Wilson spent more money in the end.

4. 读大标题阅读量

目前初中英语教科书所提供的阅读量较以前有较大幅度的增加,有题材、体裁的选择,功能与话题的设计方面均注意多样化和个性化;内容贴近学生实际。我们通过课内课外的阅读不仅有利于扩大阅读量,丰富知识和开阔视野,并拓展思路,还有利于了解英语国家的文化背景、生活风俗、思维习惯及英语特有的语言表达方式,从而提高阅读理解能力。

5. 强化阅读训练

(1) 指定阅读范围:根据不同的英语水平选择相适应的英语阅读物,自行安排时间,带着问题快速阅读。

(2) 进行阅读咨询:在阅读过程中遇到的疑难,及时咨询老师,以帮助阅读顺利完成。

(3) 检查阅读效果:阅读后通过口头练习和笔试的形式检查阅读完成
