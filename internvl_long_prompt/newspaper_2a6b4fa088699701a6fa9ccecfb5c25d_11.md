## Summary of Status Review

### Conservation Actions Implemented
The Conservation Actions Team was established in March 2001, and has since met at least twice each year for the past 15 years to carry forward the conservation and recovery program for the relic leopard frog. The Conservation Team has included Federal, State, and local agencies, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nevada Department of Wildlife, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, Clark County (Nevada), the Southern Nevada Water District, the Las Vegas Valley Water District, the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, and the University of Nevada-Reno. The primary objective of the Conservation Team was to develop and implement the 2005 Conservation Agreement. Much conservation occurred prior to finalization of the Conservation Agreement, and the Conservation Team developed the first annual work plan to be completed by partners through the Annual Conservation Agreement. The Conservation Team is in development with an anticipated management effort of late 2016. Part of the management effort is to increase population sizes and expand the distribution of the species to collect portions of relic leopard frog egg masses from natural late-pond and vernal pool sites and translocate them to appropriate sites as late tadpoles and juvenile frogs. The Conservation Team may augment any depleted, natural or introduced, relic leopard frog populations.

The main relic leopard frog conservation actions, both those completed and ongoing into the future, are:
- Remove or substantially minimize threats to extant populations and/or occupied habitats.
- Enhance existing habitat and/or create new habitat where feasible.
- Establish additional populations of relic leopard frog in existing or created habitats.
- Manage relic frogs in existing frogs and their habitats to ensure persistence in diverse aquatic ecosystems, and facilitate processes that promote self-sustaining populations.
- Monitor relic leopard frog populations.

### Current Analysis of Stressors Impacting the Relic Leopard Frog
The Analysis of Stressors Impacting the relic leopard frog currently or in the future, as required by the Act, we considered the following stressors for the relic leopard frog:
- Five required by the Act: we evaluated each of the potential stressors for the relic leopard frog and determined the following individuals have impacted, or may impact, the species:
  - Habitat loss or degradation (Factor A)
  - Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes (Factor B)
  - Disease (Factor C)
  - Inadequate existing regulatory mechanisms (Factor D)
  - Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence (Factor E)

In the SSA Report we evaluated the potential threats (identified in the SSA report as "stressors" or "stressors") and consistent with the Act's five threat factors identified in the SSA report that may be identified upon the SSA future leopard frog currently or in the future. However, there have not been any significant portion of the species' range that has been impacted by the following stressors for the relic leopard frog is endangered or threatened throughout its range. We examined the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future stressors faced by the relic leopard frog. In our files and other available published and unpublished information, we consulted with recognized experts and other species. State, and tribal agencies. Listing under the Act is warranted, based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information, that the commercial information, we find the relic leopard frog is so severe that or broad in scope as to become endangered (endangered species), or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future.

In the SSA Report we evaluated each of the potential stressors for the relic leopard frog and determined the following individuals have been impacted, or may impact, the species:
- Habitat loss or degradation (Factor A)
- Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes (Factor B)
- Disease (Factor C)
- Inadequate existing regulatory mechanisms (Factor D)
- Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence (Factor E)

Although these stressors may continue to affect the relic leopard frog, we do not believe that any of these stressors are causing a population-level risk to the species now or are they expected to do so into the foreseeable future.

### Overutilization and crayfish and bullfrog predation were evaluated in the SSA Report for the relic leopard frog impacts, respectively, across the SSA range. Thus, we do not discuss overutilization or predation further in this document. We have summarized the analysis from the SSA Report below. A complete description of those threats and how they affect the viability of the species, is included in the SSA Report.
- The effects of historical alteration of natural riverine and groundwater systems and reduced habitat connectivity to the relic leopard frog at the individual and/or site-specific level are ongoing and may continue into the future. However, there have not been any recent alterations of natural riverine and groundwater systems and reduced habitat connectivity on their leopard frog populations and their habitat. Historical modifications to the Colorado River and Virgin River effectively isolated the two metapopulations of relic leopard frog, and they will most likely never be reconnected. Although the two relic leopard frog metapopulations and most leopard frog populations are not connected, ongoing management actions by the Conservation Team minimize the isolation through captive rearing and translocation of frogs to target sites. We conclude that there are effects to relic leopard frog populations and perhaps the species from historical alteration of natural riverine and groundwater systems, but these effects are low in severity and do not threaten the persistence of the species. Some sites with the greatest potential for vegetation that can have adverse effects on relic leopard frog have reduced the extent of surface water and habitat for breeding and feeding. These effects in storms that cause removal of vegetation are reduced by severity because they are reduction through scouring, by manual removal, and by grazing.
- Burro and cattle grazing have both degraded sites and improved aquatic habitat at some sites. Low-level grazing typically provides disturbance that benefits frog habitat by removing excess vegetation. If grazing increases to heavy use, degraded habitat may become, degraded. Similarly, may burro and cattle grazing are not having a population-level effect to the relic leopard frog. Disease and nonnative fish predation have been evaluated and monitored by the Conservation Team. The presence of the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in relic leopard frog
