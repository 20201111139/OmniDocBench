# Table 1 Coupling of aldehyde, alkyne, and amine catalyzed by Au/IRMOF-3 in 1,4-dioxane^a

"Reaction conditions: aldehyde (0.250 mmol), amine (0.300 mmol), alkyne (0.325 mmol), catalyst (0.07 g), the reaction temperatures are 120, 150, and 150 °C on 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3, and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 catalysts, respectively. The reaction time was not optimization. " GC yield or conversion on based aldehydes, the product was determined by GC-MS, and ^1H-NMR.

| Entry | Aldehyde | Amine | Product | Yield (%)^b |
