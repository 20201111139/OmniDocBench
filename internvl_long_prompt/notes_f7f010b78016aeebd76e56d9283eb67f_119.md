## Great changes in my hometown

More than twenty years ago, my hometown was just a small, old and poor town. Most of people were farmers. There were few factories. The people didn't have enough food to eat and wore old clothes. They had a hard life.

Great changes have taken place in the past twenty years. The people have found a lot of ways of making money. Now there are many tall buildings. They are very beautiful. Roads are wide and clean. People can take buses or drive their own cars to go to work. Many people have cell phones and personal computers. People's living conditions have improved a lot. Thanks to the government's efforts.

My hometown is becoming more and more beautiful.

在我的家乡发生了很大的变化。

二十多年来，我的家乡只是一个又穷又小的小镇。大多数人都是农民。有几个工厂。人们没有足够的食物吃，把旧衣服穿在身上。他们有一个艰苦的生活。

在过去的二十年里，发生了巨大的变化。人们已经发现了很多赚钱的途径。现在有许多高大的建筑物。它们很漂亮。道路宽阔而干净。人们可以乘坐公共汽车或开自己的汽车去上班。许多人有手机和个人电脑。人们的生活条件有了很大的进步。感谢政府的努力。

我的家乡变得越来越美丽。
