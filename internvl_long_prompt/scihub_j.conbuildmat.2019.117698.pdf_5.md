[NOx]max: the maximized concentration of nitrogen monoxides, ppb;
[NOx]min: the minimized concentration of nitrogen monoxides, ppb;
t0: time point when UV light turns on;
t1: time point when UV light turns off;
c1: concentration of gas in (this value is equal to [NOx]max);
c2: concentration of gas in (this value is equal to [NOx]min);
ppb: parts per billion.

The latter measure is used to calculate the amount of NOx removed in micromoles per square meter per hour, using Eq. 7.

\[ r = \frac{z}{A} \left( \frac{[NOx]_{max} - [NOx]_{min}}{d} \right) \left( \frac{[NOx]_{max} - [NOx]_{max}}{d} \right) \]

where
r: amount of nitro oxides removed by the test sample, umol m^-2;
z: flow rate converted into that at the standard state (0 Â°C, 1.013 kPa, 1 L min^-1);
[NOx]max: inlet concentration of nitrogen monoxide, ppb;
[NOx]min: outlet concentration of nitrogen monoxide, ppb;
[NOx]max: inlet concentration of nitrogen dioxide, ppb;
[NOx]min: outlet concentration of nitrogen dioxide, ppb;
A: surface area of cement paste samples, m^2;
T: time to UV radiation, ideal gas at the standard state (ideal gas law).

2.3.6. Durability test (anti-abrasion performance)
The anti-abrasion performance of photocatalytic mortar is embedded by the anti-wind, anti-brasion performance. To simulate natural abrasion triggered by grade of Cw 220-2c was utilized to abrade the sample surface by 500 times back and forth. To ensure the same abrasion condition, the frictional pendulum tester (friction tester) [18], one abrasive paper with grade of Cw 220-2c was utilized to abrade the sample surface by 1000 times back and forth. To ensure the same abrasion condition, the frictional pendulum tester [18], one abrasive paper with grade of Cw 220-2c was utilized to simulate natural abrasion triggered by wind, touching, stepping, and so on. The former was friction surfaces attaching exactly the same. The latter was realized by attaching abrasive paper to the surface of a brick with constant weight; whilst the latter was achieved by updating abrasive papers for each testing sample. Each result was the average of three paralleled tests.

3. Results and discussion

3.1. Characterization of CPs

Fig. 7(the upper subgraph) presents the micrograph of NT@RG. EDS performed at point 44 reveals that the material loaded onto the surface of RG is NT. In comparison, only 46 held almost the entire surface of the islet. This is because the former was realized by attaching abrasive paper to the surface of a brick with constant weight; whilst the latter is provided by NT while some other parts are not. It is crucial to cover the entire surface of RG because NT is provided by NT while some other parts are not. It is crucial to cover the entire surface that should not be covered by NT. On the contrary, Fig. 7(the lower subgraph) exhibits the micrograph of NT@RBCs and conforms that NT is embedded into the micrograph of NT@RBCs and conforms that NT is embedded into the micrograph and some pores of RBCs during the preparation of the CPs. This statement contains two sections. First, some NT is loaded onto the surface of RBCs. It is seen from Fig. 7, since the spectrum at both points 54 and 55 display high proportion, during T1 that soaking, the RBCs itself (see Table 1) into the solution. That is to say, NT particles surrounded the RBCs and had equal concentration of NT as the solution. That is to say, NT particles surrounded the RBCs and had equal concentration as the solution. That is to say, NT particles surrounded the RBCs and had equal proportion of NT as the solution. That is to say, NT particles surrounded the RBCs and NT solution. That is to say, NT particles surrounded the RBCs and NT solution. That was the case of NT particles surrounded the RBCs and NT solution. That was the case of NT particles surrounded by the RBCs and NT solution. That was the case of NT particles surrounded by the RCBs and NT solution. That was the case of NT particles surrounded by the RCBs and the NT solution. That was the case of NT particles surrounded by the RCBs and the NT surface. That was the case of NT particles surrounded by the RCBs and the NT surface. Second, RBCs has a porous structure and extremely rough surface. Some NT particles are deposited on the surface as well as inside the pores. This is proved by the porosity and pore size distribution analysis, with results provided by the 8th, 9th and 10th rows of Table 1, with 29.5% and 26.5%, respectively. The reduced porosity of NT@RBCs relative to RBCs is due to the filling of NT after the soaking. The absolute reduction of porosity is only 2.5%, they echoes the least part of NT loading, referring to the major part of NT is provided by NT while some other parts are not. It is crucial to cover the entire NT surface that should not be covered by NT. On the contrary, Fig. 7(the lower

2.3.4. Environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM)
ESEM (Quanta FEG 250, FEI, Hillsboro OR, USA) was used to observe the morphology and microstructure of NT@RBCs. ESEM requires no pre-treatment such as drying, conduction, or dehydration. Hence, the samples were directly placed under the lens to obtain the micrographs. Were directly placed under the lens to obtain the micrographs. Were directly placed under the lens to obtain micrographs. Were directly placed under the lens to obtain micrographs. Were directly placed under the len

2.3.5. Mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP)
An automatic Mercury intrusion porosimeter (AutoPore V9500) produced by Micromeritics Instrument Company (of the United States) was used for pore structure determination. All data acquisition and processing were controlled by the computer. The maximum pressure of the instrument is 33,000 Psia, and the pore size can be measured in the range of 6-360,000 nm. Samples were analysed for energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, Oxford Instruments 7274).
