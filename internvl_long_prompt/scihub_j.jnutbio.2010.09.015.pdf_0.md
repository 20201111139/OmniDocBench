## Abstract

Lactoferrin has been associated with insulin sensitivity in vivo and in vitro studies. We aimed to test the effects of lactoferrin on human subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes. Human subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes were cultured with increasing lactoferrin (hLF, 0.1, 1, 10 μM) under differentiation and Retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1) activity. The response to insulin was evaluated through the expression of different adipogenic markers (IL6, IL1B and MCP1) and AMPK activity. In both subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes, lactoferrin (1 and 10 μM) increased adipogenic gene expressions and protein levels (fatty acid synthase, PPARγ, FABP4, ADIPOQ, ACC and STAMP2) and decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and Retinoblastoma 1 (Rb1) activity. The response to insulin increased insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation. In addition, lactoferrin decreased adipogenic effects, lactoferrin markers (IL6, IL1B and MCP1) dose-dependently in parallel to increased insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation. In addition, these adipogenic effects were reduced significantly by reducing AMPK activity (reducing pThr172/AMPK and pSer789/ACC) and Rb1 activity (increasing the pSer807/811Rb1 and AMPK activities). In conclusion, these results suggest that lactoferrin promotes adipogenesis in human adipocytes by enhancing insulin signaling and inhibiting Rb1 and AMPK activities.

## 1. Introduction

Adipose tissue is recognized as an endocrine organ that plays an important role in human diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. Adipogenesis can be divided into two stages: adipocyte commitment of adipogenic stem cells and differentiation to mature adipocytes. Adipocyte commitment under tissue culture conditions is achieved by cell cycle commitment. Cell cycle commitment can be induced by various adipogenic inducers. Transcriptional pathways important for the later stages of adipogenesis have been extensively studied. In particular, several key transcription factors such as PPARγ and members of the C/EBP protein family play pivotal roles in dictating the cascades of transcriptional activation required for establishing the terminally differentiated state [1,2]. The negative effects of inflammatory mediators on adipocyte differentiation has been extensively reported (3,4), leading to concomitant blunting of insulin glycoprotein. Lactoferrin is a pleiotropic glycoprotein (80 kDa) and a prominent component of the first line of mammalian host defense, acting on specific lactoferrin receptors that exist in a variety of cells, like monocytes, macrophages and adipocytes [5]. Its expression is up regulated and response to inflammatory stimuli [5]. Lactoferrin is able to bind and respond to several pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide, viral components and soluble components of the extracellular matrix [6]. This activity is associated with the potent anti-inflammatory activity as demonstrated in several studies [7-10]. Lactoferrin also participates in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation [11,12]. In primary osteoblasts, lactoferrin stimulated differentiation and inhibited apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal and reinitiating osteoblastogenesis in a murine bone marrow culture [13]. Recently, we have reported that lactoferrin is associated with insulin sensitivity in humans and in vitro [14]. Lactoferrin inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cell line through the increase of AMPK and 373-L1 cells. We also showed that lactoferrin inhibited adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cell line through the increase of Lactoferrin is found in considerable concentrations in breast milk (1 mg/ml) and in colostrum (7 mg/ml). LF is a natural component of breast milk which is ingested by infants. Lactoferrin administration in adipocytes.
