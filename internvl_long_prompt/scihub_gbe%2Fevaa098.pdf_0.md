## Abstract

Although the human Y chromosome has effectively shown utility in uncovering facts of human evolution and population histories, the ascertainment bias present in early Y-chromosome variant data sets limited the accuracy of diversity and TMRCa estimates obtained from them. The advent of next-generation sequencing, however, has removed this bias and allowed for the discovery of thousands of new variants for improving Y-chromosome phylogeny and computing estimates that are more accurate. Here, we describe the high-coverage sequencing of the whole Y chromosome in a data set of 19 male Khoe-San individuals in comparison with existing whole Y-chromosome sequence data. Due to the increased resolution, we potentially resolve the source of haplogroup B-P70 in the Khoe-San, and reconcile recently published haplogroup A-M51 data with the most recent version of the ISOGG Y-chromosome phylogeny. Our results also improve the positioning of tentatively placed new branches of the ISOGG Y-chromosome phylogeny. The distribution of major Y-chromosome haplogroups in the Khoe-San and other African groups coincide with the emerging picture of African demographic history, with E-M2 linked to the agriculturist Bantu expansion, E-M35 linked to pastoralist African hunter-gatherer migrations, and A-M51 potentially earlier east-south through gene flow mutation, linked to shared ancestry with central African rainforest hunter-gatherers, and A-M51 potentially earlier east-south through gene flow mutation, linked to shared ancestry to the Khoe-San.

Key words: Y chromosome, next-generation sequencing, haplogroups, Khoe-San, southern Africa.

## Introduction

The male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) has long been regarded as an effective tool in the study of human evolutionary history (Underhill and Kivisild 2007). It has proved useful mainly due to a lack of recombination along its length, making it the longest haplotypic block in the human genome (Scorzari et al. 2012), and its paternal mode of inheritance. The transmission of an intact haplotype from father to son, changing only through mutation, preserves a simpler record of its history and allows us to study the male contribution to the shaping of humanity.
