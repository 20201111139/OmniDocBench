We evaluated all known potential impacts to the Highlands tiger beetle, including the Act's five threat factors. These five were factors believed to pose imminent or significant threats to the species, and individuals may have caused the losses to habitat or have received, the updating species' information or significant and population size has improved our understanding of how the species in our current candidate assessment. We evaluated the available scientific and commercial information, and concluded that the species is resilient to these stressors and that current impacts to the species are not as strong as previously believed. As a result, the Highlands tiger beetle is no longer identified as a species of greatest concern. The species is not as high as previously identified in four range of populations across the north to Wales Ridge as a whole has areas of open lands, remnant scrub and sandhill, and patches of roadside and roadside habitat that can act as corridors or "stepping stones" for Highlands tiger beetle movement and flight, making active migration to new sites or the exchange of individuals between sites feasible for this species. In addition, storm winds, water flow, rafting, transport, and animals are possible means of botheles dispersal of the species. As a result of the new information and analysis, we no longer consider the Highlands 12-month finding for the previous tiger beetle to be foreseen threats for the following reasons: (1) The species is larger in individual numbers and occurs in more

sites across its range than previously documented; (2) the populations occur primarily on protected conservation lands; (3) more than half of the potential suitable habitat for the species consists of protected lands and conservation banks acquired in 2014 (4) for the species; (5) 16,353 acres (6,653 square miles) of the surveyed suitable habitat (5,353 square kilometers), and existing unsurveyed suitable habitat occurs in information has identified an increased number of sites that are "good" quality habitat for the Highlands tiger beetle. (6) The analysis reveals being implemented tiger beetle across the range of the Highlands tiger beetle is no longer in danger of extinction or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (threatened). Therefore, we find that listing the Highlands tiger beetle as an endangered or threatened species is not warranted through out all or a significant portion of its range. There is no significant threat to this species at this time, and consequently we are removing this species from the Service's 2011 multi-district litigation settlement with WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (in re: or Endangered Species Act Section 4(d)(2) Deadline, Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants of the United States; Annual Notice of Findings on Resubmitted Petitions for Foreign Species; Annual Notice of Findings on Resubmitted Petitions for Listings of Species Native to the United States, 76 FR 48708 (August 9, 2011)), for all 251 species that were included as candidates in the November 10, 2010, CNOR.
