Fig. 5. The expression profiles of ATF/CREBs in XX and XY gonads based on transcriptome data from gonads of tilapia at 5, 30, 90 and 180 dah. Four pairs of RNA preparations from gonads of XX and XY tilapia at 5, 30, 90 and 180 daw were sequenced using Illumina 2000 HiSeq technology in our previous study. A normalized measure of RPKM (reads per kb per million reads) was used to normalize the expression profiles of ATF/CREBs.

Statistics of ATF/CREB gene expression in tilapia gonads at four developmental stages.

| | 5 dah | 30 dah | 90 dah | 180 dah |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| XX | 132 | 197 | 70 | 118 |
| XY | 19 | 70 | 58 | 131 |
| Total | 151 | 267 | 128 | 249 |
| Average | 75.5 | 133.5 | 64 | 124.5 |
| Most diff | af5a | af4b | creb1b | creb1b |

*Total* indicates the total RPKM of all ATF/CREBs.
*Average* indicates the average RPKM of all ATF/CREBs.
*Most diff* indicates the average most differently expressed gene among all ATF/CREBs at each stage.

2009, Tussiwand et al., 2012, indicating the functional conservation of these genes between mammals and teleosts during evolution. af5a was preferentially expressed in the brain as reported in the mice (Goetz et al., 1996). The expression of af7a in tilapia was similar to that of mammalian ATF7 (Zha et al., 2005). Amazingly, in tilapia, af7a was specially expressed in the testis (indicating its potential function in male sex differentiation. Expression pattern shifts following duplication indicated neofunctionalization in af7a, as suggested previously for some regulatory genes (Duarte et al., 2006; Sand et al., 2018). ATF5 was a highly abundant liver-enriched transcript factor in human (Zha et al., 2005), however, different from af5a in tilapia, af5b showed low expression level in various tissues in tilapia.

In tilapia gonads, some ATF/CREBs expressed sexually dimorphically
