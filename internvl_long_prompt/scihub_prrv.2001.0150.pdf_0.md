## Summary
Epidemiological studies have suggested that many rare diseases with respiratory involvement have a genetic component. Molecular advances have led to increased understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases and the identification of primary ciliary dyskinesia and systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to the effect of modifier genes. There may be many genes responsible for diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to the effects of modifier genes. The genetic and systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to the effect of modifier genes. There may also be many genes responsible for diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and systemic lupus in addition to the effect of modifier genes. The genetic and systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to the effect.

## Introduction
Over the past few years there have been great advances in molecular technology. This has enabled further understanding of the molecular basis of many diseases and the interaction between the host and many diseases and the interaction between the host and many diseases and the interaction between the host and many environments that influence the host (Fig. 1). In those diseases in which the environment cannot be manipulated or modified in an attempt to overcome the abnormalities they cause. This article examines the genetic contribution in rare diseases that have pulmonary involvement and in which there has been a significant genetic contribution with the potential for future gene therapy.

## The Genetic Potential
The identification of gene defects will lead to a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of disease, should increase diagnostic sensitivity and lead to more accurate genotype-phenotype correlation. It is likely that there are more accurate genetic diagnoses in the future. In cystic fibrosis, for example, more than 1000 mutations have been identified, and in which the gene has been cloned more than 100 patients have received the gene in CF clinical trials.
