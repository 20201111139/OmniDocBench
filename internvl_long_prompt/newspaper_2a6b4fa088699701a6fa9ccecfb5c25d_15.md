believed to be affecting the species at present, it appears many of them were largely historically, though less significant than previously thought, have been mitigated, or could be managed to alleviate the effects to species. The sicklefin redhorse sucker likely experienced substantial range contraction associated with dam construction, power generation, and historical habitat degradation, but the remaining 20th century habitat, but the remaining populations appear to have stabilized with the conditions and successfully spawning and recruiting in four primary river drainages accessible from Fontana Reservoir. In the future, we expect human population growth and land development to be primary factors affecting the habitat quality in the Range. However, compared to historical land use effects, we expect the effect of these future activities to be minimized by stringent State and local land quality regulations, such as required by current regulations for land development and water agriculture, and a trend diminishing agriculture in the area. Improvements in land use practices are likely attributable to the modern regulatory environment that provides protection to the stream environment. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1934 (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.), North Carolina Act of 1971, Clean Water Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), North Carolina Sedimentation Control Act of 1973, Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act of 1975, and other regulatory actions, were enacted to control the effects of land development and pollution on the aquatic environment. Historic population records of the sicklefin redhorse sucker have persisted through significant agricultural land disturbance that resulted in considerable sedimentation of its habitat, indicating that the sicklefin redhorse sucker is likely able to tolerate moderate land disturbance and growth. Rural development and several small towns within the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker appear to be limited in certain areas due to large portions of the watershed that are permanently protected by inclusion in the Nantahala and Chattahoochee National Forests. The region is currently experiencing a trend of diminishing agricultural land use, indicating that widespread conversion to farmland is not likely. Commercial development is

likely to be limited by a lack of large metropolitan areas of interstate highways that would facilitate rapid growth. The limited high water sheds facilitate rapid sediment yield in the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker appears to have improved over the last few decades. Increasing environmental and recreational public awareness, and the actions of governmental and non-governmental organizations to improve water quality conditions have resulted in considerable sediment improvements. Therefore, we expect existing land use regulations for land development and water quality to adequately maintain the habitat quality even with the expected increase in future development. The sicklefin redhorse sucker is provided additional protection by State endangered species regulations and is listed as a species of special concern by the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. The sicklefin redhorse sucker is also listed federally as threatened by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under the Endangered Species Act, where the mainstream portions of both these rivers are designated as critical habitat for the sicklefin redhorse sucker. Approximately 43 percent of the land species is owned by State and Federal agencies or by nongovernmental conservation organizations. On these conserved properties, land development is prohibited, providing protection to the sicklefin redhorse sucker. The Little Tennessee River where the sicklefin redhorse sucker also occurs, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a license to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for the operation of the Fontana Dam. The license includes provisions to protect the nearshore habitat used by juvenile sicklefin redhorse suckers. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians

has management jurisdiction over a portion of the lands within both the Hiwassee River and Tuckasegee River watersheds. Habitat and water quality ordinances protect habitat and water quality. Approximately 65 percent of the occupied area of the Little Tennessee River is protected from development by inclusion in the Needmore Game Lands. Along the other three mainstem portions of the land is privately held and does not have any restriction on land development. When the sicklefin redhorse sucker was elevated to candidate status in 2005, the blueback herring, an invasive predator species, had been inadvertently introduced to the Hiwassee River. A major waterbody supporting the sicklefin redhorse sucker predation of young sicklefin redhorse sucker by blueback herring was a recent study examining the gut contents of blueback herring in the Hiwassee River watershed. However, a recent assessment of the blueback herring population in the Hiwassee River indicates that the blueback herring population is not likely to be the time when they are most vulnerable during the time they are most likely to be present in the Hiwassee River system in 2014-2015 produced many young adult/late juvenile sicklefin redhorse suckers that have clearly recruited since the herring invasion, even while juvenile valleye and white bass while juvenile walleye and white bass have steeply declined immediately after the invasion, suggesting the blueback herring is not preventing successful recruitment of sicklefin redhorse indicates. Therefore, recent observations have proven to be a threat to the sicklefin redhorse sucker as once feared. Many of the stressors that may affect the future redhorse sucker may be further minimized by conservation actions carried out under the recently signed CCA among the Service, North Carolina Wildlife
