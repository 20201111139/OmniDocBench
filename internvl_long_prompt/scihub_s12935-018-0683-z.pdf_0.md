## Abstract

**Background:** Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. The major histopathological subtype of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Platinum-based therapy is the standard of care for patients with advanced stage NSCLC. However, even with treatment, most patients will die of this disease within 5 years and most of these deaths are due to recurrence of the disease. One reason for recurrence is the resistance to cytostatic compounds following chemotherapy. We have shown in various anti-glucocorticoid, is a powerful cytostatic anti-cancer agent. Thus, in this work we tested the hypothesis that MF should be efficacious in inducing cytostasis and preventing repopulation of NSCLC following cisplatin (CDDP) therapy.

**Methods:** We established an in vitro approach wherein human NSCLC cells with different genetic backgrounds and sensitivities to CDDP (A549 and H1299) were exposed to MF monotherapy. Every 2 days, cell number, cell viability, and colony-forming ability of viable cells were studied.

**Results:** CDDP killed the majority of cells, yet there were remnant cells escaping CDDP lethality and repopulating the culture, as evidenced by the improved clonogenic survival of viable cells. In contrast, when cells exposed to CDDP were further treated with MF following CDDP removal, their number and clonogenic capacity were reduced drastically.

**Conclusion:** This study reports that there is repopulation of NSCLC cells following a lethal concentration of CDDP monotherapy, that NSCLC cells are sensitive to the growth inhibition properties of MF, and that MF abrogates the repopulation of NSCLC cells following CDDP therapy. Our study supports further evaluating MF as an adjunct or replacement for CDDP therapy for NSCLC.

## Background

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide [1]. The most common histopathological subtype accounting for about 85% of cases is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [2]. Despite during the past two decades there have been advances in early detection and in the development of targeted therapies that improved the outcome of this fatal cancer, the overall survival rates from NSCLC are still very low, the high mortality of this disease is consequently due to the recurrence of the disease at the time of diagnosis in most patients [3]. Consequently, new drugs and combination therapies are desperately needed to improve the outcome of this fatal cancer.

Mifepristone (MF) is a well-known synthetic steroid that has been approved to be used as antiprogestin in reproductive medicine when blockade of progesterone action is needed, and as antiglucocorticoid to prevent the hyperglycemia associated to Cushing's disease [4]. However, several studies have shown MF to be useful in the treatment of various types of cancer.
