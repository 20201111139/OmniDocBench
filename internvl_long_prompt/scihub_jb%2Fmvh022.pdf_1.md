(underlined), 5'-TGGGCATGAGCTTTTGGC-3' and 5'-GTCACATGGCTGATTCG-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted into the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pN6 encoding the hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI with the amino-acid substitution His103Met, the mutated nlpI gene was amplified by PCR using the primers described above, and the amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pN7 encoding the truncated and hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI, the fragment containing the hexa-histidine-tagged nlpI gene was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5'-TGGGCATGAGCTTTTGGC-3' and the reverse primer 5'-TGGGCATGAGCTTTTGGC-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI, then inserted were the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pN10 containing the NeoI site (underlined) 5'-TGGGCATGAGCTTTTGGC-3', the amplified DNA was digested with NcoI, then inserted were the same site of pBAD Mw- His103Met, the mutated nlpI gene was amplified by PCR using the primers described in pT99A. pN12, pN13, and pN14 were constructed by inserting the DNA fragments containing the NlpI site (underlined) 5'-TGGGCATGAGCTTTTGG-3' or 5'-CTTCAATGGCCAGGAC-3', respectively, was used as the reverse primer containing the BamHI site (underlined) 5'-TGGGCATGAGCTTTTGGC-GGAATTCG-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI, then inserted were the same sites of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pN10 containing the NeoI site as the reverse primer in PCR. To construct pN10 containing the NeoI site (underlined) 5'-TGTGGATCCATGAGCTTTTGGC-3', the amplified DNA was digested with Ncol, then inserted were the same sites of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pT99A, pN12, pN13, and pN14 were constructed by inserting the DNA fragments

Expression and Purification of Hexa-Histidine-Tagged NlpI Protein. E. coli cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmids. The transformants were grown in LB broth at 42°C for 4 h, then incubated in LB broth containing 0.1% arabinose at 42°C for 4 h for expression of the fusion genes. Once with ice-cold 50 mM sodium were pro- suspended in 4.8 ml of containing 300 mM NaCl (buffer A), 10 mM imidazole and 1% Triton X-100, and disrupted by sonication for 15 min at 4°C. The mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 x g for 20 min at 4°C. The bound proteins were eluted with 4 ml of buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole and then contained in a 2 ml of buffer A containing 100 mM imidazole, and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ DECA XP Ion trap mass system, Thermo Electron, coupled online with a capillary HPLC (Michrom Bioresources) was used to acquire MS/MS spectra.
