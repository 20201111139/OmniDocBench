## Exercise 3.2.4

What is the empirical formula of a compound containing 40.0% C, 6.71% H, and 53.28% O?

### Answer

CH<sub>2</sub>O

## Derivation of Molecular Formulas

Recall that empirical formulas are symbols representing the relative numbers of a compound's elements. Determining the absolute numbers of atoms that compose a single molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by various measurement techniques. Molecular mass, for example, is often derived from the mass spectrum of the compound (see discussion of this technique in the previous chapter) and molecular mass can be measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which will be introduced in later chapters of this text.

Molecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound's molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an empirical formula mass is the sum of the average atomic masses of all the atoms represented in an empirical formula. If we know the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance, we can divide this by the empirical formula mass in order to identify the number of empirical formula units per molecule, which we designate as \( n \):

\[
\frac{\text{molecular or molar mass (amu or g/mol)}}{\text{empirical formula mass (amu or g/mol)}} = n \text{ formula units/molecule}
\]

The molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the empirical formula by \( n \), as shown by the generic empirical formula A<sub>x</sub>B<sub>y</sub>:

\[
(\text{A}_x\text{B}_y)_n = \text{A}_{nx}\text{B}_{ny}
\]

For example, consider a covalent compound whose empirical formula is determined to be CH<sub>2</sub>O. The empirical formula mass for this compound is approximately 30 amu (the sum of 12 amu for one C atom, 2 amu for two H atoms, and 16 amu for one O atom). If the compound's molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu, this indicates that molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the empirical formula:

\[
\frac{180 \text{ amu/molecule}}{30 \text{ amu}} = 6 \text{ formula units/molecule}
\]

Molecules of this compound are then represented by molecular formulas whose subscripts are six times greater than those in the empirical formula:

\[
(\text{CH}_2\text{O})_6 = \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12}\text{O}_6
\]
