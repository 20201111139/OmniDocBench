## Abstract
We propose a surrounding gate MOSFET with vertical channel (SGVC cell) as a 1T DRAM cell. To confirm the memory operation of the SGVC cell, we simulate the memory effect and fabricated the highly scalable SGVC cell. According to simulation and measurement results, the SGVC cell can operate as a 1T DRAM having a sufficiently large sensing margin. Also, due to its vertical channel structure and common source architecture, it can be made into a 4F² cell array. Therefore, the SGVC cell is very promising for future DRAM.

## I. Introduction
To overcome the scalability issues and process complexity of 1-transistor/1-capacitor DRAM cell, capacitorless 1-transistor (1T) DRAM cells have been recently proposed and investigated [1]. The mainstream IT DRAM cell proposed is a floating body MOSFET (FBMOSFET) [1]. The FBMOSFET is realized by a MOSFET with its body floating electrically. The FBC is on-insulator MOSFET formed on partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. When excess holes are swept out of the floating body, the cell state can be defined as "1" (decreased Vth). On the other hand, when excess holes are swept out of the floating body through the increased drain junction state can be defined as "0" (increased Vth) by measuring the drain current difference between "1" and "0" states of the cell. We can sense whether the holes are accumulated in the floating body since the floating body can be charged by the drain current. This can be done by measuring the drain current difference between "1" and "0" states of the cell. In this simple process, we can have a cell area below 4F² [1, 2, 3]. It is noted that it has a floating body which can be charged or discharged. Therefore, the FBC has no complicated storage capacitor. Therefore, the FBC has a simple process and can have a cell area below 4F² [1, 2, 3].

## II. Simulation Results
Fig. 1 schematically shows the operation principle of an SGVC cell. It can be noted that it has a floating body where holes are accumulated for memory effects. To verify memory cell operation, 2-D device simulation was performed. We used ATLAS as a simulator. Excess holes are generated by impact ionization in this simulation. Excess holes are listed in Table I. The difference in the body potential of each state and the Icp-VG characteristics were extracted first, in order to show the accumulation of holes in the floating body of the SGVC cell. The drain current of "1" state is larger than that of "0" state. This is due to the increase of the body potential when excess holes are accumulated in the floating body through writing operation, hence lowering the threshold voltage, which in turn increases the drain current. Subsequently, the drain current as a function of the time was extracted to show the retention time of the SGVC cell.
