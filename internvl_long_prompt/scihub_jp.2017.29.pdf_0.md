### OBJECTIVE:
The objective of this study is to assess and modify an existing decision aid and field-test decision coaching with the modified aid during consultations with parents facing potential delivery at 23 to 24 weeks gestation.

### STUDY DESIGN:
International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument (IPDASi) scoring deficits, multi-stakeholder group feedback and α-testing guided modifications. Feasibility/acceptability were assessed. The Decisional Conflict Scale was used to measure participants' decisional conflict before (T1) and immediately after (T2) the consultation.

### RESULTS:
IPDASi assessment of the existing aid indicated 11/35 (31%) of criteria were met. Twenty-three subjects (12 pregnancies) participated in field-testing. IPDASi score increased to 26/35. Twenty subjects completed all questionnaires. Most participants (85%) would definitely recommend this form of consultation. Decisional conflict scores decreased (p = 0.001), between T1 (52 ± 8) and T2 (10 ± 16).

### CONCLUSION:
Field testing demonstrated that consultations using the aid with decision coaching were feasible, reduced decisional conflict and may facilitate shared decision-making.

## INTRODUCTION

Given continued parental dissatisfaction<sup>1,2</sup> and the limit of viability, the objectives of this study were to: (1) assess and, if necessary, modify an existing PDA for use in our institution facing potential delivery at 23 or 24 weeks GA to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using a PDA in this situation and to determine the effect on parental decisional conflict.

## METHODS

The local ethics review boards approved the study. One author (GM) received permission from its developers to modify an existing PDA (six four-page script). The study was conducted at The Ottawa Hospital, General Campus, and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. The study included three main steps: (1) modification of the PDA, (2) testing of decision coaching with the modified PDA and (3) field-testing of decision coaching with the modified PDA.

Assessment of existing PDA

Four authors of GM, S Dunn, S Dunn and TD, performed, independent assessment of the existing PDA<sup>1</sup> using the IPDASi (v4.0) that provides a framework to certify decision support tools through evaluation and improving their content, decision support and tools implementation. Nine of the 44 items were not applied as the PDA did not involve a screening test. A PDA must not receive 'yes' for all quality criteria to be considered a 'BLA'. A score greater than three on all certification criteria for IPDAS certification. Scoring differences were discussed until consensus was achieved.<sup>4</sup> Unmet criteria allowed identification of the existing PDA's shortcomings. To complement the assessment, an existing multi-stakeholder working group that ranked health-related factors of extremely premature infants completed a survey to identify the decision that could be important to parents.
