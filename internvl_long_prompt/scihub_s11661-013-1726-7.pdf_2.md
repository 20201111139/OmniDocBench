contents of Mn and Si, which is consistent with the literature.16,30 After being SHTed for 8 hours, the almost SHT for 8 hours. As shown in Figure 2(c), however, the EBSD results with a mean angular deviation (MAD) of 0.452, lower than 0.7, which is considered to be critical matrix as shown in Figure 2(b). It is also interesting to note that the Chinese script x-Fe phase becomes unstable. This is transformed into a β-Fe phase with a body-centered cubic with a, b, and c as short intermetallic platelets, leading to the fragmentation of the x-Fe.

The chemical compositions of the iron-rich intermetallics in Alloy B in the as-cast and SHTed (for 8 hours) conditions measured by SEM-EDS are shown in Table III. It can be found that higher Al contents are detected in the x-Fe and STed β-Fe after SHT than the corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from the liquid of the surrounding Al matrix due to the small sizes of the SHT. Compared with the as-cast Fe, it can be found that the iron content in x-Fe is reduced after β-Fe (Table III), and the replacement of the Cu by Al β-Fe (STed β-Fe) to distinguish it from the β-Fe formed β-Fe (STed β-Fe) to distinguish it from the β-Fe formed directly. The precipitation of the liquid metal during solidification is further confirmed a low MAD value of 0.258 as measured by EBSD (Figure 2(d)). The STed β-Fe is most likely to have the same crystal structure as the β-Fe (tetragonal with a and b of 0.634 nm and c of 1.488 nm),1 due to their similar diffraction patterns. The β-Fe-like solidified β-Fe (STed β-Fe) particles can be found in the as-cast Fe, it can be found that the iron content in x-Fe is
