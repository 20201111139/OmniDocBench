## 207.638 tons of free tonnage raisins acquired by handlers from producers through the week ending June 19, 2004, plus 134,145 tons of inventory, equates to 398,783 tons of natural condition raisins, or 373,117 tons of packed free raisins, that are available to handlers for raisin use. This is 130 percent of the quantity of NS raisins shipped during the 2002-03 crop year (305,133 natural condition tons or 286,260 packed tons). Oleates were included in the NS variety beginning with the 2003-04 crop year. In addition to the order plus 10 offers, $9,987,671 in reserve raisins such as national emergency, crop failure, change in economic or marketing conditions, inadequate or improper carrier, or if free tonnage shipments in the current marketing order exceed the prior crop year. Such reserve raisins may be sold by handlers to additional raisin users. Implementing the make-even offers of the Committee's Guidelines 5.714 tons of 2002-03 NS for reserve raisin for tons of handlers for $98,967. Free tonnage deliveries as of June 19, 2004, were 207,638 tons, which is 35,000 tons less than the 242,638 tons shipped during the same period last year. Adding to the 135,714 tons to the 3,855 tons in reserve being offered to handlers for free use under ยง989.67(f) of the order, the full 211,493-ton make available the 221,493-ton free tonnage shipments from August 2003 through May 2004 are 1,859,125 tons.

The order contains authority to a given year, limit the portion of another crop that can be marketed freely in any outlet by raisin handlers. This is used to stabilize control mechanism is used to stabilize supplies and strengthen market prices and conditions. Pursuant to ยง989.54(d) of the order, this volume continues in effect final crop NS percentages for 2003-04 regulation is 70 percent free and 30 percent reserve. Free tonnage raisins may be sold by handlers to any markets. Reserve raisins must be held in a pool for the account of the Committee and are disposed of through certain programs authorized under the order. Volume regulation is warranted this season for NS raisins because week ending June 19, 2004, combined with the carryin inventory of 129,345 tons, the results in a total available supply of 425,970 tons, which is about 200 percent trade demand. (Oleate 11,493-ton was included in this computation because combined with the NS variety type beginning with the 2003-04 crop year.) The current regulation procedures have helped the industry address its marketing problems by keeping supplies in balance with domestic and export market needs. The current supply regulation procedures fully provide for market expansion and help reduce the burden of oversupplies in the domestic market.

## Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. Accordingly, AMS has prepared this final regulatory flexibility analysis.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions so that small businesses are not unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing Order No. 989, as amended, regulates the handling of raisins produced in California. Small entities are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000. Almost all raisin handlers are small entities under the definition of small entities.

## Raisin grapes are a perennial crop, so production in any year is dependent upon plantings made in earlier years. The sun-drying method of producing raisins involves considerable risk because of variable weather patterns. Even though the product and the industry are viewed as mature, the service has experienced considerable change over the last several decades. Before the 1975-76 crop year, more than 50 percent of the raisins were packed and sold directly to consumers. Now, over 60 percent of raisins are sold in bulk. This means that raisins are now an ingredient in another product such as cereal and baked goods. In addition, for several years the raisin grapes were sold to a few large wineries for crushing. Since the 1970's, over 50 percent of the raisin grapes were sold to the wine market. For the crushing season, NS raisins because then, the percent of raisin-variety grapes sold to the wine industry has decreased. California's grape varieties, three raisin-variety grapes, wine grapes, and table grapes. Raisin-variety grapes are the most versatile of the three types. They can be marketed as fresh grapes, crushed for juice or as a production of wine or juice concentrate, or dried into raisins. Fluctuations in the fresh grape, wine, and weather-related factors, as well as fluctuations in raisin supply, cause this type of variability into the raisin market. Although the size of the crop for raisin-grape varieties may be the same, the amount dried for raisins depends on the demand for crushing. This makes the marketing of raisins a more difficult task. These supply fluctuations can result in price instability and discourage long-term market conditions. Volume regulation is helpful to the raisin industry because it lessens the impact of such fluctuations and marketing. For example, producer prices for NS raisins through the 1997-98 seasons, although table below. During those years, production varied from a low of 387,063 tons in 1993-94, or about 42 percent. According to Committee data, the total production in 1998-99 was 427,007 tons, which includes processed raisins, has varied from a low of $904.60 in 1997-98 to high of $1,049.97 in 1993-94. Total production in 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons increased significantly due to increased plantings and favorable weather conditions, back short crops during those years. Producer prices dropped dramatically for the last three seasons due to record-
