## Abstract

The behavior of the linear magneto-resistivity \( \sigma_{xx} \) of the surface-state electrons (SSE) on liquid ^3He exposed to the resonant microwave radiation is experimentally studied in the temperature range corresponding to the crossover between the gas-atom and the ripplon scattering regimes. The variation of \( \sigma_{xx} \) near the microwave resonance is attributed to the heating of SSE due to the absorption of microwave photons. At high temperatures, where scattering is due to ripplons, \( \sigma_{xx} \) is found to increase. The complicated line shape of the resistivity signal observed at the intermediate temperatures is attributed to the interplay between two regimes.

## 1. Introduction

Experimental spectroscopic studies of surface-state electrons (SSE) above liquid helium provide important information about various aspects of this system, such as the subband structure, quantum transport properties and relaxation phenomena. Such studies have been carried out under scattering regime the absorption of MWs of frequency \( \omega \approx \Delta_{21}/\hbar \) with electrons above both liquid ^3He [1,2] and liquid ^4He [3]. The recent interest in such studies has been evoked by the theoretical proposal [4] that SSE occupying these two lowest Rydberg states can be used as electronic qubits controlled by the microwave (MW) field. The motion of the SSE is confined to a dimension of the while the motion perpendicular to the surface is restricted to the hydrogen-like quantum Rydberg states. The motion along the surface is free except for the scattering from helium vapor atoms or surface capillary waves (ripplons). For SSE above liquid ^3He, which was used as a substrate in our experiment, the crossover between these two scattering regimes lies at \( T \approx 0.3 \) K. Under the typical experimental conditions, the energy difference \( \Delta_{21} \) between the ground and the first excited Rydberg states \( \Delta_{21} \) is much larger than \( T \), and therefore almost all electrons occupy the lowest state. The quantum transitions between Rydberg states can be induced by the resonant interaction of SSE with MW radiation. Recently, we showed that in the gas-atom scattering regime the absorption of MWs frequency \( \omega \approx \Delta_{21}/\hbar \) is accompanied by a strong heating of SSE caused by a disbalance between the large absorbed power and a very slow energy relaxation rate [5]. An important feature of this process is an efficient channel to transfer the excitation energy absorbed by electrons from MW field to the thermal energy of in-plane motion. An excited electron decays back to the ground state as a result of the collision with a helium atom or a ripplon. In either case, the energy exchange during collision is negligible, and the decayed electron returns to the ground state carrying a large kinetic energy \( \Delta_{21} \), which is quickly redistributed among other electrons owing to the very high electron-electron collision rate (the heating effect [5]). The heating effects the scattering rate, therefore it can be observed experimentally as a resonant change of the electron resistivity. E.g. in the gas-atom scattering regime, \( \sigma_{xx} \approx \Delta_{21} \), which is...
