## Madera Canyon, Stephen's ruffle beetle
is no longer found at the Bog Springs Campground location, as the habitat no longer exists. The last collected specimen of Stephen's ruffle beetle has not been collected or documented since 1993, despite the Service's surveying for the species at one remaining known location, and at numerous other nearby locations with potential habitat. Based on the reviews with the best available scientific and commercial information, we believe that the information, we believe that the Stephen's ruffle beetle is extinct. The preponderance of evidence has been documented in artificial habitat created by a water tank's leaking pipeline and campground. Only two specimens have ever been found from Sylvester Spring, the only relatively intact spring habitat remaining where the species was known to historically occur. Sylvester Spring may have been occupied by ruffle beetle and may have only recently been occupied by ruffle beetle and may have only recently been occupied by ruffle beetle and may only have been occupied by ruffle beetle and may only have been occupied by ruffle beetle and may only be occupied by ruffle beetle and may only be occupied by ruffle beetle and may only be occupied. Historically, the species was found in springs in Madera Canyon from which water was pumped into concrete boxes and piped to recreational water for domestic and recreational water supplies. Up until 1993, when Stephen's ruffle beetle was last detected, the species appears to have been in extremely low numbers within Sylvester Spring, making it difficult to detect, in contrast to the relatively large numbers collected in the 1980s and 1990s at the Bog Springs Campground site. The species has not been documented since 1993.23 years ago, when one individual was found at Sylvester Spring as part of a survey for Stephen's ruffle beetle in Madera Canyon. Beginning in 2012, Sylvester Spring was surveyed multiple occasions. The most habitative survey efforts occurred at Sylvester Spring for the Bog Springs Campground survey methods. Three different methods were used in an effort to find the species, and no Stephen's ruffle beetles were found. While Stephen's ruffle beetle is small in size (and therefore difficult to find), the absence of beetles, therefore, should be detected regardless of the time of year (surveyed based on their life history (multi-year metamorphosis and relatively long lifespan). Therefore, based on the best available scientific and commercial information, the Service believes Stephen's ruffle beetle to be extinct.

## Summary of Status Review
The SSA Report for Stephen's ruffle beetle is a summary of the information and incorporates the best available scientific and commercial information for this species. Our analysis leads us to believe Stephen's ruffle beetle is extinct. Impossible, to prove, and the Service has no policy specifically defining the level of information necessary to conclude that a species should be considered extinct. In any species there is uncertainty in drawing a conclusion of extinction. For Stephen's ruffle beetle, we have carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the species. The biological and ecological information we have documented in the SSA leads us to believe that the Stephen's ruffle beetle is extinct, and, as such, it is not listed or proposed as an endangered or threatened species under the Act. Although the Act does not directly address the status of considering a species for listing where the best available information indicates that the species is likely already extinct, the purpose of the Act is to prevent species from becoming extinct. If we believe the species is already extinct, by definition, the species cannot be in danger of extinction. Therefore, we did not further evaluate whether Stephen's ruffle beetle is in danger of extinction throughout its range in an endangered species, or is an evaluation. Whether or not further evaluation is warranted, the Service believes that the Stephen's ruffle beetle is likely to become in danger of extinction throughout its range in the foreseeable future (a threatened species), or is an
