Thus, a constraint of 3 mol % is defined for the maximum amount of reactants leaving the column from the top. The liquid holdups in the reactive trays are selected as 2000 mol to have a reasonable liquid height. The column is composed of 50 mol % of F<sub>A</sub> and 50 mol % of F<sub>B</sub>. Kinetic parameters of the ternary system are given in Table S. The basic design procedure is based on the existing paper in the literature.22

The optimization problem for the ternary system with inert stripping trays, N<sub>S</sub>, (2) mol % is defined for the maximum amount of reactants leaving the column from the top. The number of reactive trays N<sub>R</sub>, (3) the number of rectifying trays N<sub>R</sub>, (4) the column pressure P, and (5) the reflux ratio R<sub>E</sub> is the objective function. The same basis of economics that is used for the binary system without inert component.

Table 6 gives the optimum design considered. For the base case of α<sub>390</sub> = 2.00, the optimum operating pressure of the column is 9 bar. The column having 7 stripping, 12 reactive, and 7 rectifying trays. The column diameter is 1.00 m with the vapor boilup of 55.06 mol/s. The total investment cost is $32.42 × 10<sup>6</sup>, while the cost of energy is $23.33 × 10<sup>6</sup>/yr. Assuming a payback period of 3 years, the TAC is $41.48 × 10<sup>6</sup>/yr. There is a decrease of α<sub>390</sub>, but the change is not dramatic. This decrease is reasonable because lower pressure helps the VLE by reducing relative volatilities and increasing the separation factor from 2.00 to 1.75. The decrease of α<sub>390</sub> from 2.00 to 1.75 results in a higher change of separation trays. On the other hand, the increase in the number of reactive trays is more remarkable for the case of α<sub>390</sub> = 1.50. The other dramatically variable decreases. Thus, the capital and energy costs get significantly higher as the value of α<sub>390</sub> decreases.

Figure 10 shows the temperature profiles of three relative volatility cases. There is a sharp temperature profile for the case of α<sub>390</sub> = 2.00. This is especially true for the stripping section. The value of α<sub>390</sub> = 1.75 moderates the decrease of temperature profile. The size of the hump in the reactive zone also decreases as α<sub>390</sub> decreases.

### 3.2. Ternary System with Inert Component. This flowsheet of ternary system with inert component is given in Figure 9. This system involves four components. However, one of them is an inert component I in terms of the reaction. Since it is volatility assumed that the reaction is carried out in the liquid phase, the inert component I is removed from the distillate without taking part in the reaction. The other fresh feed stream F<sub>B0</sub> contains pure reactant B. While the heavy product C leaves from the bottom, the column has three zones: a stripping section, a reactive zone, and a rectifying section, respectively.

The main design objective is to obtain the purity of the bottoms product at 98 mol % C. On the other hand, the amount of reactants escaping from the distillate stream should also be considered. This is especially true for the stripping section. The value of α<sub>390</sup> has an identical volatility with the inert component I.
