other parts. The SEM pictures in Figure 6 show that the liquid preconcentrate exists as a separate phase trapped into solid PEG 3350 clusters. Confocal Raman microscopy described in the next section showed a similar result using the principle of confocality. Modern Raman micro-spectrometers allow rapid chemical mapping with high spatial and spectral resolution. It is possible to reveal the exact composition and spatial distribution of complex mixtures of drug substances and excipients at a resolution in the 350 nm range, at very low concentrations and at a pixel resolution of up to several hundred thousand pixels.

In separate experiments, hot-stage light microscopy (not described in this report) showed that the clusters and nodes disappeared upon heating to 60°C, and reappeared upon cooling below 50°C.

## Characterization of Drug-Loaded Solid Microemulsion Preconcentrates by Confocal Raman Microscopy

The compositions of the solid microemulsion preconcentrate with 4% and 8% drug loads selected for further evaluation as potential dosage forms for I are given in Table 3. For comparison, compositions of prototype solid dispersions developed using PEG 3350-solid-polysorbate 80 mixtures are also given in the table.

One well-established technique for identification and characterization of the solid state of pharmaceutical specimens is Raman spectroscopy. It is a robust and reliable method yielding information in high quality with a low limit of detection. In addition it requires minimal sample preparation and allows for high throughput screening and automation.27 In combination with an optical microscope, Raman spectroscopy can be implemented to map a specimen and to provide spatially resolved chemical information on the underlying species. In recent years, progressively in laser equipment, development of high quality holographic filters and gratings as well as advances in
