All solutions containing methanesulfonate (CH₃SO₄⁻) were adjusted to pH 7.4, Cl⁻ was the major anion on all solutions except those containing HEPES at 5 mM (extracellular solutions) or 10 mM (intracellular solutions) and were adjusted to pH 7.4. Cl⁻ was 9.4 ± 0.6 mM for K⁺m, K⁺n, K⁺p, Na⁺m, Na⁺n, Na⁺p, and 70 mM for Nystl.

epithelium labeled with an anti-OMP antibody. Labeling is seen of cells in the deeper layers of the epithelium, the location of sensory neurons, and not of cells in the most luminal layer, the location of supporting cells. (The spotty labeling is similar to what has been shown previously (Graziadei et al., 1980). Labeling is also present at the lumen of the epithelium and likely corresponds to the labeling of dendritic processes of VNO sensory neurons (Johnson et al., 1993). To obtain dissociated VNO neurons, the VNO and its bony encasing were dissected free from the anterior nasal cavity and the epithelium was removed. This was done by cutting the VNO at the level of the OE and at the caudal end of the nasal cavity, and thus no contamination of VNO neurons by olfactory epithelium neurons is expected. For most experiments, dissociated VNO neurons were prepared by incubating the epithelium in divalent-free solution containing trypsin and collagenase and then triturating the tissue with a fire-polished glass pipette. Dissociation using either collagenase alone or no enzyme did not produce as many healthy-looking cells. To determine whether the enzymatic treatment altered the properties of the ion channels, some experiments were done without the use of enzymes; these experiments are explicitly stated as such. A population of cells were identified as sensory neurons by morphological criteria. These cells had an ovoid body with SD = 11 ± 1.4 (mean ± SD; n = 12) and a dendritic process that varied in length but was >40 μm. Some dendrites were some short process that probably resulted from retraction during the dissociation process. This identification was confirmed by labeling with anti-OMP antibody (Fig. 2,4B) and by the detection of action potentials in these cells (see next section). Two typical cells are shown in Figure 2, C, and D, as visualized with differential interference contrast microscopy. Cells used for electrophysiology all had a similar appearance, with a clearly identifiable dendrite bearing microvilli. Mouse olfactory neurons were also dissociated for comparison and typical neuron cell is also shown in Figure 2F at the same magnification. Note that VNO neurons are several times larger than olfactory neurons.

## Action potentials in response to current injections

The electrical properties of VNO neurons were examined by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of VNO neurons. The resting potential of VNO neurons was −83.2 ± 2.7 mV (mean ± SEM unless otherwise noted), which was significantly more depolarized than the resting potential of olfactory neurons measured under similar conditions (−81.8 ± 2.1 mV, n = 6). The input resistance of VNO neurons (3.3 ± 0.8 GΩ, n = 6) was not significantly different from that of olfactory neurons (2.3 ± 0.8 GΩ, n = 8). The capacitance (8.8 ± 0.3 pF, n = 39) was several times larger than that of olfactory neurons (1.8 ± 0.2 pF, n = 8), and the capacitance (8.8 ± 0.3 pF, n = 39) and the capacitance (8.8 ± 0.3 pF, n = 8) was several times larger than that of olfactory neurons (1.8 ± 0.3 pF, n = 8), and the capacitance (8.8 ± 0.

The responses of a VNO neuron to hyperpolarizing current injections gave a membrane time constant of 15.3 ± 4.2 msec (n = 7). The response to hyperpolarizing current injections gave a membrane time constant of 15.3 ± 7.4 pA are shown in Figure 3A. The response to hyperpolarizing current injections gave a membrane time constant of 15.3
