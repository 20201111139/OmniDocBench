\* P values to test differences in SIRs across NHL subtypes were computed using likelihood ratio test derived from Poisson regression models adjusted for age at first primary NHL, sex, and latency, with log of expected numbers of cases included as offset. Exact numbers of cases are not reported for categories with ≤5 observed cases to maintain patient confidentiality.

†SIRs and exact Poisson-based 95% CIs compared the number of observed cases with that expected in the general population (additional details provided in "Methods").

# Figure 1. Risk for developing second primary stomach cancer among adult 1-year DLBCL and MZL survivors by site of DLBCL or MZL, 2000 to 2014

SIRs and exact Poisson-based 95% CIs compared the number of observed cases to that expected in the general population (additional details provided in "Methods"). P values to test differences in SIRs were computed using a likelihood ratio test derived from Poisson regression models stratified by age at first primary NHL, sex, and latency, with the log of expected numbers of cases included as an offset. All statistical tests were 2 sided. Created using GraphPad Prism (version 7; La Jolla, CA).
