**Final Results of Expedited Sunset Reviews of Antidumping Duty Orders: Light-Walled Rectangular Pipe and Tube from Mexico, Turkey, and the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea (of China)**

**AGENCY:** Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce.

**SUMMARY:** On April 2, 2013, the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated the first sunset reviews of the antidumping duty orders on light-walled rectangular pipe and tube (light-walled pipe) from the Mexico, Turkey, and the People's Republic of China (PRC), and the Republic of Korea (Korea) (collectively, the subject countries). The Department finds that revocation of the antidumping duty orders on light-walled pipe from the subject countries would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping, and that revocation of the antidumping duty orders on light-walled pipe from the subject countries would not be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of dumping.
