the contract: "Fifth" will be changed to "third."

Rule 829 requires, unless otherwise agreed, securities loaned from the fifth business day following the loaned from the fifth business day following the notice is given to the business day. Rule 362 will require the contract price of bonds dealt in and interest made "regular way" and delayed delivery to include interest computed only to the third business day rather than the fifth business day following the day of the contract. Rule 371(a) will be changed to "third" instead of "fifth" business day, preceding the interest payment date for delivery on or after a cash adjustment for coupons paid. The rule will be changed prior to the third business day preceding the record date. Similarly, Rule 431 states that coupons paid on the business day preceding the record date will be changed to "third" instead of "fifth" business day, preceding the interest business day, preceding the interest payment date will have a cash adjustment for coupons paid. Rule 431 states that coupons paid on the business day preceding the record date will be changed to the third business day preceding the record date. This will be changed to the second business day preceding the record date. The transaction on other than a business day or the ex-dividend date shall be an ex-dividend rights on the third preceding business day rather than on the fifth preceding business day when ex-warrant trading will be changed. The expiration of warrants to the second business day preceding date of expiration of warrants. Warrants to the second business day preceding date of expiration of warrants occurs on a day other than a business day, the expiration date will be changed from fifth business day preceding expiration date to third business day. Rule 823 requires that all transactions pursuant to the "five day delivery plan" which requires regular way transactions to settle on the fifth business day after the transaction date. The proposed rule change will all references from five to three.4

*Rule 823 also demonstrates the "five day delivery plan" by stating that a transaction that occurs on Monday will settle on the Monday of the following week. This language will be changed to be consistent with the "third day delivery plan."

Rule 825(b) provides that the ex-dividend date for transactions in stock for which there exists a transfer facility in Philadelphia will be the fourth business day preceding the record date. The will be changed to fourth business day. In the event the record date is not a business day, the ex-dividend date will be changed from the fifth preceding business day to the third preceding business day. Rule 825(c) establishes the equivalent ex-dividend record date for securities with transfer facilities outside Philadelphia. For these stocks, the ex-dividend date will be the second business day following the fourth business day preceding the record date.

The PHIL's implementation of these rule changes will be consistent with the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia and National Securities Clearing Corporation's implementation of the schedule is as follows:

| Trade date | Settlement date |
|------------|------------------|
| June 2 Friday | June 9 Friday |
| June 5 Monday | June 12 Monday |
| June 6 Tuesday | June 12 Monday |
| June 7 Wednesday | June 12 Monday |

If the Exemptions currently provided to alter Rule 156-1, the PHILX may need to submit additional rule proposals. It is anticipated that the proposed rule change will become effective the same date as the proposed rule change 156-1.

As proposed rule 156-1, consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission is proposing to amend the rule to reduce the risk to clearing corporations, their members, and public investors, which is accomplished by reducing the time period for settlement of most securities transactions which will correspondingly decrease the number of transactions available for clearing and settlement system at the given time.

Any proposed change also is consistent with Commission Rule 156-1 which will require brokers or dealers to settle most securities transactions no later than the third business day after the trade unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the parties at the time of the transaction.

The PHILX does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition.
