|a continuation of similar levels of impact from the stressors affecting this species as we have in the past. We believe we have continued rates of use and continued over the impact years would not likely result in significant effects to the occupied range of the Arkansas darter. Although the impact to the Arkansas darter is expected to be lower than the impact to the Arkansas darter, we expect little change on a range-wide basis. We could see some range contraction in the western Cimarron and upper Ratlesnake Creek basin in Kansas and Oklahoma due to water depletion. As well as small portions of the Colorado River in Colorado. However, we do not expect to see a reduction in the eastern portion of the range (Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma) due to development. However, we do not expect to see a reduction of the species overall (e.g., no loss of entire species populations).|an endangered or a threatened species and that the best available scientific and commercial information indicates this species is in danger of extinction (endangered) or likely to become endangered (threatened) in the foreseeable future (within the next 30 years) throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Arkansas darter populations appear to be stable and widespread. We do not believe there are now fewer threats on the Arkansas darter than have previously been understood; the species is expected to maintain a high level of redundancy and representation into the future; we know of more currently-occupied populations than we have previously assessed; and while groundwater depletion are expected to continue in approximately 25 percent of the range, we do not expect this to result in a reduction (in redundancy) of the species overall (e.g., no loss of entire species populations).|
|Finding|Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act’s five factors, we find that the Arkansas darter is not in danger of extinction, nor likely to become endangered, within the foreseeable future (a threatened species). In conclusion, we find that this species is not in danger of extinction or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (a threatened species).|

|We evaluated the current range of the Arkansas darter to determine if there is any potential geographic area for the species. Groundwater withdrawals are currently concentrated in the western and central portions of the range, and lower Oklahoma River basins in areas, Oklahoma, and approximately 25 percent of the geographic range of the species. Additional stressors outside of this area are generally low level, localized impacts. The 25 percent of the range affected by groundwater withdrawal does not meet the biological criteria for a “significant” (i.e., loss of that would be expected to increase the entire vulnerability) to extinction. If 25 percent of the range were lost, the species would still have approximately 75 percent of its range that is not expected to be subject to negative effects of water depletion. Therefore, we determined that there are no significant portions of the species’ range where the Arkansas darter meets the definition of “significantly” (i.e., loss of that would be expected to increase the entire vulnerability) to extinction.|We evaluated the current range of the Arkansas darter to determine if there is any potential geographic area of concern for the species.

|Summary of Status Review|Background|
|Background|The species formerly described as the black mudalia is a small snail 13 millimeters (mm) (0.5 inches (in)) in length and belongs to the aquatic snail family Pleuroceridae. The species was described as the black mudalia, was found clinging to clean gravel, cobble, and/or log jams in flowing water on the Locust and Forks drainages in Jefferson and Blount Counties, Alabama.|The species formerly described as the black mudalia is a small snail 13 millimeters (0.5 inches) in length and belongs to the aquatic snail family Pleuroceridae.

|The petition we received on April 20, 2010, petitioned the Service to list the black mudalia as endangered or threatened under the Act.|The petition we received on April 20, 2010, petitioned the Service to list “rivers in North Alabama” by T.A. Contreras as Anculosa melanoides, but confused as Anculosa speciosa, a species of freshwater snail, for the second half of the 20th century. For the second half of the 20th century, the black mudalia was considered to be extinct. However, in 2003, Dr. Russell Minton published a paper (Minton 2003) with a re-description of what he believed, with a Conch’s description of the species, with a re-description of what he believed, with a Conch’s description of the species.|
|No new information regarding the black mudalia was presented in 2011, and on September 27, 2011, we published a 90-day finding (76 FR 59886) announcing that settlement agreement for the that settlement agreement constitutes the Services’ 12-month finding on the May 4, 2004, petition to list the Arkansas mudalia as endangered or threatened species.
