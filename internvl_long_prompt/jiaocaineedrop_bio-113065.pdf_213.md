## SKELETAL MUSCLE PAIRS

To move bones in opposite directions, skeletal muscles often consist of muscle pairs that work in opposition to one another. For example, when the biceps muscle (on the front of the upper arm) contracts, it can cause the elbow joint to flex or bend the arm, as shown in Figure 6.3.5. When the triceps muscle (on the back of the upper arm) contracts, it can cause the elbow to extend or straighten the arm. The biceps and triceps muscles are examples of a muscle pair where the muscles work in opposition to each other.

## SKELETAL MUSCLE STRUCTURE

Each skeletal muscle consists of hundreds — or even thousands — of skeletal muscle fibers, which are long, string-like cells. As shown in Figure 6.3.6, skeletal muscle fibers are individually wrapped in connective tissue called endomysium. The skeletal muscle fibers are bundled together in units called fascicles. Each fascicle contains between ten and 100 (or even more) skeletal muscle fibers. Fascicles, in turn, are wrapped together to form individual skeletal muscles, which are wrapped in connective tissue called epimysium.

The connective tissues in skeletal muscles have a variety of functions. They support and protect muscle fibers, allowing them to withstand the forces applied to them. They also provide pathways for nerves and blood vessels to reach the muscles. Also, the epimysium anchors the muscles to tendons.

## Structure of a Skeletal Muscle

- Bone
- Tendon
- Epimysium
- Fascicle
- Endomysium
- Muscle fiber
- Perimysium
- Blood vessel

## Figure 6.3.6: Each skeletal muscle fiber has a structure of bundles within bundles. At each level of bundling, a connective tissue makes up a membrane around the muscle. At the level of the muscle cells, fascicle, and the whole muscle are surrounded by endomysium, perimysium, and epimysium, respectively. All connective tissues merge together to make a tendon that attaches the muscle to bones.
