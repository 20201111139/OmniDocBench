1. 事实推断

这种推断常常针对某一个或几个具体个案，是比较简单的推断，进行这种推断，首先在文章中根据以推断的有关文字的来，进行分析，得出结论。

如：According to the passage, which of the following can you most possibly watch on TV?

A. You often play football with your friends after school.

B. Your teacher has got a cold.

C. A tiger in the city zoo has run away and hasn't been caught.

D. The bike in the front of your house is lost.

在阅读材料中，有这样一段文字：

Secondly, a news story has to be interesting and unusual. People don't want to read stories about everyday life. As a result, many stories are about some kind of danger and seem to be "bad" news.

根据这段文字，我们可以推断：电视报道的新闻故事必须是有趣的和平常的。答案是C。

2. 指代推断

确定代词的含义和指代对象是阅读理解常见题型。要确定代词所指代的对象，关键在于对所上下文的正确理解。指代代词的指代词，其单复数形式英语被指代的词一致。因此数的形式可作为识别指代对象的辅助标志。

3. 逻辑推断

这类题目往往是要求根据文章所提供的背景，人物的表情，动作和语言来推断人物的态度或感情。
