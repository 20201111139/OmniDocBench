performed the total energy of these phases as a function of volume and their Murnaghan equation of states were fit to the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation. The energy-volume curve of the structures is presented in Fig. 2 and as shown ZB structure has the lowest energy. On the other hand, to determine the most stable structure at finite pressure and temperature, the free energy G = E + PV - TS should be used. The calculated free energy G = E + PV - TS of the ZB, 14m2 and Imm2 phases at 0 K and 0.500 GPa is 53.2 GPa, which is relatively close to the theoretical values 46 GPa and 48.98 GPa [18, 19]. The method modulus can vary with a wide range according to the methodology of the study. The bulk modulus of the 14m2 (binary β-tin) phase is calculated to be 70.7 GPa and the bulk modulus of the Imm2 phase is calculated to be 75.7 GPa. In general, our results agree with the experimental and theoretical results.

Our density functional calculations are basically completed at zero Kelvin temperature and entropic contributions can be ignored. Therefore, the enthalpy values, H = E + PV, including the pressure-volume effect are determined. The volume is affected by the pressure, which is also clearly reflected in the enthalpy calculation.

Simple comparison of the static lattice enthalpies of ZB state, 14m2 (binary β-tin) and Imm2 state determines the pressure of the transition between these phases. The crossing of three enthalpy curves indicates a pressure-induced phase transition between these phases. The computed enthalpy curves of the ZB, 14m2 and Imm2 phases are plotted as a function of pressure in Fig. 3. As can be seen from the figure, the enthalpy curves of the 14m2 phase and Imm2 phase have the same enthalpy and intersect with that of ZB phase at 4.8 GPa, indicating a first order phase transition between these phases. On the other hand, from the transition volume data, we also calculate the bulk modulus of these phases. For the zinc-blende state, our bulk modulus is

The pressure-volume relation of CdTe obtained through the constant pressure simulation can be seen in Fig. 4. As can be seen from the figure, the volume monotonically decreases with increasing pressure to 15 GPa. When the pressure is increased from 15 to 20 GPa a noticeable decrease in volume is begun and from 20 to 30 GPa the transition is shown to be stable phase, which is typical for a first order phase transition. The structural analysis brings out that zinc-blende CdTe converts into a 14m2 (binary β-tin) structure. This tendency is indeed anticipated when some conditions, namely the use of ideal structure, the size of the simulated structure etc. are considered. Consequently, simulated systems have to cross a significant energy barrier to transform from one phase to another. In this study, we are particularly interested in understanding the transformation mechanism to control structural phase transition. Therefore, as a next step, we studied the atomic movement during a phase transformation by
