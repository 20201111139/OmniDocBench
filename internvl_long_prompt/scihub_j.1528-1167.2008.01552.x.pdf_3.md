## Pentylentetrazol-induced seizure test

Rank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal administration of AEDs in the pentylentetrazol-induced clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide > ethosuximide > valproate = ethosuximide > phenytoin (Table 1). Phenytoin was ineffective up to a dose of 300 mg/kg. In a slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant potency in this test with oral administration in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide > ethosuximide > valporate > oral rufinamide (â‰¥ 2000 mg/kg) and phenytoin (800 mg/kg) did not inhibit pentylentetrazol-induced seizures in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticonvulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.

## Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced seizure tests in mice

Intraperitoneal bicuculline and picrotoxin were effective at nontoxic doses in the bicuculline and picrotoxin clonic seizure tests (ED50 ~ 50-75 mg/kg) and showed partial protection from strychnine-induced tonic seizures (37.5% protection; Table 1). Overall, the general order of potency in these tests was phenobarbital > rufinamide > valproate = ethosuximide > phenytoin (Table 1). In the strychnine-induced tonic seizure test, phenytoin had the lowest ED50 value, suggesting that the greatest protection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Phenytoin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice.

## Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice

The median toxic dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide (TD50) in the rotorod test of behavioral impairment was 500-1000 mg/kg. The TD50 for rufinamide was higher than that for comparator AEDs (Table 1), indicating a lower toxicity. Higher ED50 values of rufinamide were not associated with increased side effects of very high-dose intraperitoneal rufinamide (1000 mg/kg) included decreased motor activity, ataxia, muscle relaxation, decreased respiration, and death (one animal died; the other appeared normal). Higher doses of the comparator drugs increased the incidence of side effects (2 of 2 animals) and resulted in death (all animals) in 3-4 h (4 x TD50). The safety ratio for rufinamide in mice (TD50/ED50 > 19.2 [intraperitoneal] and > 23.8 [oral]) was consistently greater than for phenytoin, phenobarbital, and TD50/ED50 > 19.2 [intraperitoneal] and > 23.

The median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required to produce loss of righting reflex in mice (HD50) was > 500 and > 1000 mg/kg (Table 5). Rufinamide had a numerical value of phenytoin (HD50 > 500 and > 1000 mg/kg, respectively). Rufinamide, ethosuximide, and valproate had comparable HD50 values of 178 and 135 mg/kg, respectively.
