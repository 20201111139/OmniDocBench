Worldwide, 31 percent of consumers said they're eating healthier food, continuing a trend we've observed over the past two years. However, the latest survey results also show that consumers today aren't necessarily equating "healthy eating" with products that are labeled "organic."

In Western Europe, there is still some growth in natural and organic products. For example, in Italy and France, survey respondents who claimed to have purchased natural products and organic products were more likely than others to say they'd recently purchased those who said they'd bought organic products. Such purchases are also by 13 percent.

Some consumers eat only dairy-free (Exhibit 3). Other low-carb or high-protein diets include gluten-free, vegetarian, and paleo.
