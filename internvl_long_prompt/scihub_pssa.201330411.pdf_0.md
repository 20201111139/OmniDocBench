In this work, the harmful effect of triplet excitons on light lifetime of poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV)-based organic light emitting diodes vinylene) (PPV)-based organic light emitting diodes is demonstrated. A model in which the triplet population in a PPV derivative is increased by blending the polymer with the triplet sensitizer platinum (II) octaethylporphyrine ketone (POEPK). The increase in the triplet concentration of the polymer affects both the initial decay and the long-term evolution of luminescence and leads to a drastic acceleration of device degradation, reflected in a dramatically shortened lifetime.

## 1 Introduction

Despite the progress made in the field of polymer-based organic light emitting diodes (PLEDs) during the last years, continuing efforts in research are necessary for a substantial breakthrough in the commercialization of these devices. The lifetime and stability of the devices are still one of the main issues in need of improvement [1-5]. Usually, luminescence degradation and an increase in operating voltages with prolonged driving are observed in polymer-based OLEDs [4]. Thereby the electrical fatigue in polymer-based OLEDs [4] is usually attributed to the formation of polarons in the polymer matrix [1]. The device lifetime is normally defined as the t50 or half lifetime – the time in which the luminescence decreases to 50% of the initial value during operation at constant current. According to spin statistics, the ratio of singlet to triplet excitations in OLEDs is 1:3. However, differing ratios have been reported for many materials [6-9] but no consensus on the value has been reached. Nevertheless, due to the high lifetime of triplet excitons densities are of several orders of magnitude as high as those of singlet excitons [10, 11]. Therefore the influence of the higher triplet concentration on device lifetime is monitored. As a result, an accelerated degradation due to the increased triplet-to-singlet ratio will be reported.

## 2 Experimental

This study focuses on derivatives of OC1C10-PPV (poly(2-propoxy-5-2'-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene), which is used both in pristine state and blended with the ketone sensitizer platinum (II) octaethylporphyrine (POEPK). The POEPK material was purchased from Lumitec GmbH. The PLEDs consist of an ITO anode, a PEDOT:PSS hole injection layer (40 nm), an OC1C10-PPV layer (130 nm) and a Ca cathode covered by an Al layer (100 nm). All devices were fabricated and characterized in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The polymer layers were spin coated
