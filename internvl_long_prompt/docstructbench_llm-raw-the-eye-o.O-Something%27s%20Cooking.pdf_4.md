The calzone golem is a strange construct dreamed up by Andolyn and Gendrew and created through a deli-cate process that mixes alchemy and bakery in ways never before imagined by mortal beings. It looks like a doughy humanoid, and smells of cheese and tomatoes.

### Combat

As a golem, the calzone golem is incapable of strategy or tactics. Its creator can command it if within 60 feet. When not directly controlled, most calzone golems stand as steadfast guardians of kitchens, pantries, or dining halls.

**Breath Weapon (Su):** Once every 5 rounds, the calzone golem can exhale a cloud of nauseating gas as a zone golem can. This is identical with a *stinking cloud* spell.

### Construction

A calzone golem's body is created from a mixture of fine ingredients, including approximately 100 pounds of flour, 50 pounds of cheese, four gallons of tomato sauce, and large quantities of salt, yeast, and sugar. Mushrooms, olives, or other ingredients may be added to the mixture, as desired. Season with oregano and black pepper to taste. All ingredients must be fresh and of the highest quality.

The golem costs 10,000 gp to create, including 500 gp for the ingredients. Assembling the body requires a successful Profession (cook) check (DC 15), along with 2 hours of baking at approximately 450 degrees. The creator must be 9th level and able to cast *arcane eye*. The spell is cast from the creator and requires *burning hands*, *grease*, *major creation*, and *stinking cloud*.
