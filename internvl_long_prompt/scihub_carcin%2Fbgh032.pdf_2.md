# NF-κB activation by bile

## Results

### DCA specifically switches off IκB and IL-8

RNA extracted 24 h from untreated OE33 cells and 24 h after treatment with 300 μM DCA at pH 7.0 was analysed using five different pathway specific membrane arrays. By far the most prominent of the DCA induced gene expression changes were the switching off of IκB and IL-8. As IκB and IL-8 are transcriptional targets of NF-κB, this suggests activation of NF-κB by DCA. Figure 2a demonstrates a cancer pathway array and a signal transduction array, both IκB and IL-8 are substantially up-regulated 24 h after DCA treatment. Figure 2b also shows a number of other genes in expression after exposure to DCA. By duplicate array, we mean that the expression change data available. In the right hand columns is the time point at which the expression changes in the central column reflect the relative strength of the expression changes.

This table contains list of genes whose expression was consistently altered after exposure to DCA. By duplicate array, we mean that the expression change data available. The right hand columns is the time point at which the expression changes in the central column reflect the relative strengths of the expression changes.

### Fig. 2. Membrane array analysis of DCA treated OE33 cells, 24 h post-exposure.

a. Cancer pathway arrays were used to study gene expression abnormalities induced by 300 μM DCA relative to untreated OE33 cells. These example arrays show those hybridized with cDNA from untreated OE33 cells and cDNA from OE33 cells 24 h after DCA exposure. A number of other genes are up-regulated by DCA, particularly evident in the cancer pathway array in (a). These genes (and others) are identified in Table 1.

b. Two example signal transduction arrays are shown: those hybridized with cDNA from untreated OE33 cells and cDNA from OE33 cells 4 h after DCA exposure.
