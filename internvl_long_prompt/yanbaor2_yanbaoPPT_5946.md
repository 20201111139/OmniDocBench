Still moving away from the middle
Consumers continue either to trade up or trade down, moving away from mid-market brands. Although globally the trade-up trend is slightly stronger than the trade-down trend, the survey results show that differences at the country level last year when we saw a marked increase in trade-up behavior among consumers in India, we predicted a continuation of that trend-driven largely by rapid-driven modernization in retail outlets, and the premiumization of several CPG categories, including beauty products, beverages, and packaged food. Indeed, the latest survey shows that India had the highest trade-up rate, at 25 percent (Exhibit 2).

Turkey and China, too, had trade-up rates of 20 percent or higher. Turkish consumers have been active up-traders over the past two years, in the 2010s the latest figures is, unsurprisingly, down slightly, due to tougher economic conditions in Turkey. In China, gains in consumer confidence have led to a 2 percent increase in discretionary spending.4 A mere 2 percent increase of Chinese consumers said they traded down.

In some Latin American and African countries, on the other hand, trade-down rates were upward of 20 percent. Consumers trade-up rates were in the single digits, whereas in these developing economies, down-traders often opted for lower-priced, private-label products rather than retailers' private-label products. Only 9 percent of do-it-yourself retailers in Latin America said they switched to private-label brands. In South Africa, 75 percent of the same pattern was seen in traders who did not switch to private-label brands. In the US, 75 percent of the same pattern was seen in an number of CPG categories, including food and household products. This suggests that more consumersâ€”launching new products and should therefore be considering entry-level products in these countries.

What it means to be thrifty
The most prevalent change in spending behavior varied greatly by country. Even among consumers who said they cut spending, the methods for doing so weren't necessarily the same from one country to the next.

In 39 percent of countries, including the United States,5 many consumers said they still buy their preferred brands but do so less frequently. In 19 percent of countries, including the United States, buyers said they still buy their preferred brands but do so less frequently. In 19 percent of countries including the United States, buyers said they still buy their preferred brands but do so less frequently. For 2015, fewer US consumers said they waited with 2015, fewer US consumers said they waited for discounts or coupons before making a purchase, suggesting that US bargain hunters, spend more freely now than they found a cheaper retailer to shop at. This trend underscores the importance of channel strategy for CPG companies: they need to build a strong presence in channels that are perceived as low price, such as club stores, discounters, and certain online retailers.
