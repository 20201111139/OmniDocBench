## Fig. 1. General schematic of the third floor of the pilot-scale flour mill used for all experiments. The black boxes, white circles, and rectangles represent large structural features on the third floor such as support columns, milling equipment, sifters, and large storage bins. The bioassay area positions are numbered 1-10. The location of each aerosol application position is denoted as A1, A2, and A3 (1/3 dose at each position). Aerosol application 4 was released from all three locations A1, A2, and A3 (1/3 dose at each position). Source: Schef et al. (2018), used by permission.

## Bioassays

Tribolium confusum larvae used in the study were from a pesticide-susceptible strain maintained at the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service-Center for Grain and Animal Health Research, Manhattan, KS (USDA-ARS-CGARRH). Tribolium confusum colonies are reared on 95% organic whole-wheat flour and a 5% brewer's yeast at 27Â°C, 60% RH, and 24 h in Petri dishes (22 cm) filled with approximately 0.5 m^2 of diet. Testing arenas used in this study were individual 60 x 15 mm (-2.2 in x 0.6 in) and placed in side larger 150 x 20 mm (5.9 in x 0.8 in) plastic Petri dishes. Concrete dishes were prepared based on Arthur (2015), briefly, a dry powder driveway material (Rockite, Inc., Shorewood, OH) was mixed with water to create a thin slurry, poured in the bottom of Petri dishes to a depth of -0.5 cm, and held at ambient conditions for approximately 7 d. Inside each Petri dish, four current study for residual bioassays at 2, 4, and 6 wk post-aerosol treatment and was contained no diet at time of exposure to aerosol. The testing arenas described by Schef et al. (2018) were placed at ten different positions on the third floor (Fig. 1). Nine positions also had macroinvertebrate testing units (APS 3312, TSI Inc., Shorewood, OH) to collect data on aerosol particle concentration and size distribution.

## Aerosol Dispersal Patterns

To assess the strength of the effect of the aerosol application, an efficacy value index was created to convert the three morphological states (larvae, pupae, adult) to a single logical value, ranging from 1, the weakest efficacy response of five index values, with the strongest response with five larvae. All of the index analysis (Zar 2010) was performed using a three-way analysis of variance based on bioassay position, application method, and residual week as the main effects.

(Campbell et al. 2014). The efficacy index ranged from 1, the weakest efficacy response of five index values, with the strongest response with five larva, pupae, and larvae indicated in brackets were the following:

1 (5,0,0), 2 (4,1,0), 3 (4,0,1), 4 (3,2,0), 5 (3,1,1), 6 (3,0,2), 7 (2,3,0), 8 (2,2,1), 9 (2,1,2), 10 (2,0,3), 11 (1,3,1), 12 (1,2,2), 13 (1,1,3), 14 (1,0,4), 15 (0,4,1), 16 (0,5,0), 17 (0,4,2), 18 (0,3,2), 19 (0,2,3), 20 (0,1,4), 21 (0,0,5).
