# 29948 Federal Register / Vol. 85, No. 97 / Tuesday, May 19, 2020 / Notices

## Authority for Conducting the Matching Program
The authority for conducting the matching program is 42 U.S.C. 653a(3).

### Purposes
The purpose of the matching program is to provide each participating state agency administering TANF with new hire, quarterly wage, and unemployment insurance information to assist them in establishing or verifying eligibility for assistance, reducing payment errors, and maintaining program integrity, including determining whether duplicate participation exists in or outside the applicant or recipient state. State TANF agencies may also use the NDNH data for the purpose of updating the recipients' reported participation in work activities and updating participants' contact information by the state TANF agencies.

### Categories of Individuals
The categories of individuals involved in the matching program are adult members of households who have applied for or receive TANF benefits.

### Categories of Records
The categories of records involved in the matching program, which may include personal identifiers, are new unemployment insurance information. The specific data elements that will be provided to OCSE in a state agency input file are:

- Submitting Information (two-digit state code)
- Standard input file transmission date
- Adult TANF caseload month and year of adult TANF applicants and recipients
- Social Security number
- Adult TANF applicant/recipient's first, middle, and last name
- Name/Social Security number verification request
- Optional:
  - Passback data (state agency information used to identify individuals within the input file to be returned on the output file)
  - Returned state data (indicates whether the state agency requests NDNH data on the output file, whether the hire agency requests unemployment insurance even if the information was provided by that same state)

## OCSE will compare the Social Security numbers in the state agency input file to the Social Security numbers in the NDNH file. The NDNH will provide the individuals' quarterly wage and insurance availability information to the individuals' state agency with any available new hire, quarterly wage, and unemployment insurance information in NDNH records pertaining to those individuals whose records are contained in the state agency input file. The NDNH data elements that OCSE will return to the state agencies are as follows:
