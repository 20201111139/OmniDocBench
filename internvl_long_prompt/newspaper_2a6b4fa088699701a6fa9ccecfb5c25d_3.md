|listing is appropriate: we require evidence that these stressors are operative threats to the species or its habitat, either singly or in combination, to the point that the species meets the definition of an endangered species under the Act. In making our 12-month findings, we considered and evaluated the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the past, present, and future stressors and threats, reviewed the petition, information available in our files, and other available published and unpublished information. This evaluation may include information from recognized experts; Federal, State, and tribal governments; academic institutions; foreign governments; private entities; and other members of the public. We also consider the status of any listed or proposed species that may impact or be impacted by the species we are evaluating. The standards for the evaluation of threats under the Act are provided in the December 6, 2007, listing priority guidance (LPN)(71 FR 69034), and those have been supplemented by a joint policy published in the Federal Register on July 1, 1994 (59 FR 34270). The LPN is used to help determine the relative priority of preparing a listing rule for all candidate species. The difference in listings priority between species is related to the immediacy and magnitude of threats, as well as to the taxonomic uniqueness of the species. The LPN numbers range from 1 to 12, with 1 being the highest priority.|

|Background|
|The Arizona treefrog (Hyla wrightorum) is a small (4.6 centimeters (cm) (1.8 inches (in))) green frog with a dark eyestripe that extends past the side of the body, and sometimes onto the glide area. It occurs in Madrean oak woodland, mixed conifer, and Plains grasslands at elevations of approximately 1,525 to 2,590 meters (m) (5,000 to 8,500 feet (ft)). The species requires ponds for successful reproduction.|
|The Arizona treefrog is known to occur within Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico. In Arizona and New Mexico, the Arizona treefrog occurs along the Mogollon Rim (central Arizona), the White Mountains and Cane Creek Hills on the Arizona/Sonora, Mexico border, and farther south in Mexico (in the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental ranges). We refer to these mountain ranges as the “sky islands.” Within the sky islands, the Arizona treefrog has three general localities at Rancho Los Fresnos, Sonora, Mexico, and from 13 to 15 verified localities and one unverified locality in the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona. The treefrog has continued to persist in Arizona’s sky island mountain ranges and is not biologically or ecologically isolated from the treefrog has recently been found in new treefrog localities in the White Mountains and Cane Creek Hills on the Arizona/Sonora, Mexico border, and perhaps in ciénegas in the vicinity of Rancho Los Fresnos. The Arizona treefrog was originally defined based on treefrog historical originally defined based on treefrog historical information from the Huachuca-Canelo population. However, recently the Service has received information on treefrog localities in Arizona outside of the Huachuca-Canelo population, but within the DPS boundary, but not meet the requirements of the Service’s Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments (DPS Policy) published in the Federal Register on February 7, 1996 (61 FR 4722). The DPS serves as the basis for determining whether a population is discrete and whether the population is significant to be considered a DPS that warrants listing. Whether the population is discrete and whether the population is significant, then the DPS is determined to be both discrete and significant. The DPS Policy requires the Service to evaluate the conservation status of the population to determine whether the population falls within the Act’s definition of an “endangered species” or “threatened species.” On the basis of the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that our DPS Policy population of the Arizona treefrog is discrete but it is not significant (i.e., it is not biologically or ecologically important to the taxon as a whole. Regarding the taxon as a whole, we have reviewed the best available scientific and commercial information and the evidence relative to potential threats in the future. The morphological, physiological, behavioral, and ecological characteristics of the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog is not based on its geographic separation from the other two populations on the Mogollon Rim and in Mexico.|
|The four classes of information we considered in the DPS Policy as possible considerations for evaluating significance are: (1) The DPS’s persistence in the face of natural or manmade factors; (2) the DPS’s ecological and biological significance to the taxon to which it belongs; (3) the DPS’s evidence of genetic characteristics that do not differ markedly from those of other Arizona treefrog populations.|
|Summary of Status Review|
|Based on new information and review of previously informed studies, we find that the Huachuca-Canelo treefrog does not meet the requirements of the Service’s Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population|
