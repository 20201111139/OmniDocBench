### Abstract:
This study aimed to evaluate cancer risk and possible risk factors in patients diagnosed with empyema. A total of 31,636 patients with newly diagnosed empyema between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2010 were included in the study. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to compare the cancer incidence in these empyema patients to that in the general population. Adjusted hazard ratios were also calculated to investigate whether characteristics increased cancer risk.

During the 12-year study period, 2,654 cancers occurred in 31,636 patients, yielding a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 2.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.57-2.78). We excluded cancer that occurred within 1 year of empyema diagnosis to avoid surveillance bias. The excluded cancer rate was significantly increased (SIR 1.50, 95% CI 1.41-1.58), specifically, patients with empyema had a higher SIR of cancers of the head and neck (1.50, 95% CI 1.21-1.83), esophagus (2.56, 95% CI 1.89-3.46), liver (1.94, 95% CI 1.69-2.22), biliary tract (1.18, 95% CI 0.93-1.45), lung (1.62, 95% CI 1.39-2.45), and diabetes mellitus (1.25, 95% CI 1.19-1.36) age â‰¥ 60, male sex, and liver cirrhosis were independent risk factors for cancer development.

### Introduction:
Empyema is the accumulation of pus in the thoracic cage that often results from a progressive deposition of parapneumonic fluid. Persistent infection eventually results in the formation of a thick, fibrous peel that encases the lung. Even with the advance of antibiotics and pneumococcal vaccines, this still accounts for approximately 5% of cases of pneumonia. Incidence of empyema has been increasing in recent decades.3 About 15% of empyema patients die and 30% of patients require intervention on the pleural space.4 Most studies focus on short-term complications of empyema;5 however, the long-term effects of this disease, including cancer, have not been well studied.

Increased cancer risk in patients with inflammatory and infectious diseases has been reported in many studies.6 Furthermore, the effects of chronic pulmonary inflammation on the development of lung cancer have been well documented.7 However, no study to date can focus on the association between empyema and future cancer risk.

Using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan, we conducted a nationwide population-based study to examine the relative risk of malignancies, including specific cancer types, in patients with empyema.

### Materials and Methods
#### Data Sources
Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program, which began in 1995, is a mandatory universal health insurance program that covers more than 99% of the Taiwanese population.8 The NHIRD is managed by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRIs) of Taiwan and consists of detailed healthcare data from more than 28 million enrollees. It includes traditional Chinese medicine, inpatient services, emergency, dental, and convalescent long-term care services. The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database is a subset of the NHIRD and is a representative database containing 1,000,000 patients and is randomly selected for Chinese medicine, inpatient services, emergency, dental, and convalescent long-term care services.
