SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Introduction The OCC currently does not require the approval of the OCC before a national bank substantially changes the composition of its assets through sale or other disposition, nor do they require prior OCC review or approval of a national bank’s charter before it becomes a “national bank” charter. Likewise, our regulations do not address a dormant national bank’s increase in asset size through purchases or acquisitions to engage again in the business of banking. On January 7, 2004, we proposed to add to our regulations a prior approval requirement for these fundamental changes in a bank’s composition in order to address these concerns. See 69 FR 892 (Jan. 7, 2004). As described in the preamble to the proposed rule, these concerns may arise from increased operations risk, increased concentration risk (especially where asset composition changes as a result of divestiture), and the ability of new management to implement the bank’s strategy successfully. In addition, a dormant bank being revived may propose to engage in activities that significantly deviate or change from the bank’s original business plan or operations. If ill conceived, poorly planned, or inadequately executed, these new activities can expose the bank to potential financial consequences and for the bank’s adverse condition, in the extreme situation, for its viability. Even entry into lines of business that are traditionally elevated levels of risk to a present elevated levels of risk expand a substantially or too quickly from a dormant status, misjudges its markets, or fails to ensure that bank management and internal control systems keep pace with the change. The preamble also noted that concerns raised by the acquisition of a dormant bank by a third party necessitates a need for the OCC to thoroughly review the nature of the services and products that might be initiated by an acquiring entity. For the reasons discussed in this preamble, we are adopting in final form|PART 989—RAISINS PRODUCED FROM GRAPES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR part 989 which was published on April was 2004, is adopted as a final rule without change.

The final rule provides that, in the second, the OCC will apply the same factors as among other factors, the establishment of a de novo bank.
