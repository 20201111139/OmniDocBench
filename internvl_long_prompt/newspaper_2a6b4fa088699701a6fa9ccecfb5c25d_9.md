# Federal Register / Vol. 81, No. 194/Thursday, October 6, 2016/Rules and Regulations

## Two Kentucky Cave Beetles (Louisville Cave Beetle (Pseudanophthalmus troglodytes) and Tatum Cave Beetle (Pseudanophthalmus parvus))

### Previous Federal Actions

The Louisville cave beetle and Tatum cave beetle were added to the Federal list of candidate species in the November 15, 1994, Federal Register (59 FR 58982) as Category 2 candidate species. On November 15, 1994, CNOR (59 FR 58982) identified the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum cave beetle as candidate species for which information was proposed to list but for which the taxon was possibly appropriate for listing. The proposed listing rule was withdrawn on October 28, 1996, (61 FR 7596) so both species were no longer considered candidate species and were removed from the candidate list.

In the October 30, 2001, CNOR, the Service re-evaluated both cave beetle species and placed them in the Service's own internal process with an LPN of 5 (66 FR 54808). The Service with received comments on May 11, 2004, to list both cave beetles, including the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum cave beetle as endangered or threatened species. In the May 11, 2005, CNOR (70 FR 24870), the Service determined that listing the Louisville cave beetle was warranted but precluded by higher priority decisions. Further, we have included both species since addressed in this finding (2001 (66 FR 54808); June 13, 2002 (67 FR 40657); May 4, 2004 (69 FR 24867); June 19, 2002 (67 FR 40657); May 11, 2005 (70 FR 24870); September 12, 2006 (71 FR 54833); December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176); November 9, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370); November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994); December 5, 2013 (78 FR 72910), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584)).

### Background

These two species are small (about 4 mm (0.16 in) in length), predatory cave beetles that occupy moist habitats containing organic matter transported from outside the cave. Members of the genus Pseudanophthalmus vary in rarity and widespreadness. Pseudanophthalmus genus vary in rarity and widespreadness. Pseudanophthalmus species are found in many caves to species that are extremely rare and commonly restricted to one or only a few low cave.

### Status of Review

When the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum cave beetle were identified as candidate species for protection under the Act in the October 30, 2001, CNOR (66 FR 54808), the Service considered both chemicals of spills, discharges of large amounts of pollutants, and alterations of cave entrances, and the highway of construction energy processes by disruption of cave entrances, and the highway of construction energy processes by disruption of cave entrances, and the disruption of cave entrances, and the disruption of cave entrances, and the disruption of cave entrances, the disruption of cave entrances, and the disruption of cave entrances, and the disruption of cave entrances.

Louisville cave beetle and Tatum cave beetle were assigned an LPN of 5. Over the last 2 years, field surveys have provided new information and on the species. The distribution and abundance of both species were assessed and an LPN of 5. Louisville cave beetle

The Louisville cave beetle is restricted to four caves in Jefferson County, Kentucky, while the Tatum cave beetle (Pseudanophthalmus parvus) is known from one cave (Tatum Cave) in Marion County, Kentucky.

However, we have no evidence suggesting that these stressors are adversely affecting P. troglodytes at a population level.

With respect to the Tatum Cave beetle, we have no evidence suggesting that the species is still extant in Tatum Cave. The species was last relatively abundant (20 individuals) in Tatum Cave when first observed by Krecker in 1957, but the species has not been observed in Tatum Cave since 1965, when two individuals were observed. Since 1965, extensive surveys have been completed on eight separate occasions using search techniques similar to those used by C.H. Krecker and T.C. Barr (i.e., methodical visual searches of all available habitats). Three searches of these all survey efforts also involved the use of baited pitfall traps (small cups buried in the substrate with cheese) placed in several locations within Tatum Cave for periods of one week. Despite all of these searches, no Tatum Cave beetles have been observed in Tatum Cave since the last observation by Barr in 1965 (a period of 51 years).

The Tatum Cave beetle is small in size and may be more difficult to locate than some cave organisms; however, both Krecker and Barr were able to find species using methodical, visual searches of suitable habitats in Tatum Cave. Subsequent researchers have used identical search methods on eight separate occasions and have not observed Tatum Cave beetles. Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we believe it is reasonable to conclude that the Tatum Cave beetle is extinct. The Service encourages continued surveys for the Tatum Cave beetle in Tatum Cave, as subsequently found to be extinct, we can reevaluate its legal status under the Act in the future.
