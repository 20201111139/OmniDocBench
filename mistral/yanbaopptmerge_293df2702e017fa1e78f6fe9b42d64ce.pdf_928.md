55. Students were asked to bring their favorite fruit to class. $95 \%$ of the fruits consisted of banana, apple, and oranges. If oranges were twice as popular as bananas, and apples were $5 \%$ less popular than bananas, what are the percentages of each individual fruit?
56. The nursing club held a bake sale to raise money and sold brownies and chocolate chip cookies. They priced the brownies at $\$ 1$ and the chocolate chip cookies at $\$ 0.75$. They raised $\$ 700$ and sold 850 items. How many brownies and how many cookies were sold?
57. Three roommates shared a package of 12 ice cream bars, but no one remembers who ate how many. If Micah ate twice as many ice cream bars as Joe, and Albert ate three less than Micah, how many ice cream bars did each roommate eat?
58. A clothing store needs to order new inventory. It has three different types of hats for sale: straw hats, beanies, and cowboy hats. The straw hat is priced at $\$ 13.99$, the beanie at $\$ 7.99$, and the cowboy hat at $\$ 14.49$. If 100 hats were sold this past quarter, $\$ 1,119$ was taken in by sales, and the amount of beanies sold was 10 more than cowboy hats, how many of each should the clothing store order to replace those already sold?
59. A farmer constructed a chicken coop out of chicken wire, wood, and plywood. The chicken wire cost $\$ 2$ per square foot, the wood $\$ 10$ per square foot, and the plywood $\$ 5$ per square foot. The farmer spent a total of $\$ 51$, and the total amount of materials used was $14 \mathrm{ft}^{2}$. He used $3 \mathrm{ft}^{2}$ more chicken wire than plywood. How much of each material in did the farmer use?
