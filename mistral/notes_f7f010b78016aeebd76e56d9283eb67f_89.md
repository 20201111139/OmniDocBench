# 2 致退间读方定 

(1) 狭阔：指将您生性推父背后隐、襁围以及相关的背景的任何观念呈活泛
强，对父背大的内落狭阔以及可能违反到的词汇，然后阅读父背阔，绝，并对狭阔进行验证，引证。同时抓住主题问，关键词，从而使路德从整体上去理解和提握父背中心。
(2) 疏读：指与您生根基的異父父，领会父背大要，辨析父母，遵循高背密钧，进阶抓住父背中心。
(3) 要读：在对展全父基础上进行要读，从回想个别事实细节经的问题。准此细节做的问题不能直接表现文中提到要等，要进行修合，归纳，我趋才能在得。要解题取准自拖可在得的事实和细节的基础上应总体合，归纳，我推，向路在得同背的事实和细节。应强阵违反数据，望向，人称，代词的指忧、动作的行为的失败，动作行为指与承恩者，拖点和反间，承恩者式，因果，条件，内涵与外延等。如：

One day Mrs. Wilson went shopping with Tracy and Ben.
They went to the supermarket in the new shopping center:
"Why do you buy things here?" Tracy wanted to know.
"Because they are cheaper here than at the corner store near our home," Mrs Wilson said. "Help me check the prices, please."

The Wilsons were not rich and Mrs Wilson also always careful with her money. She looked carefully at the prices of things. She
beught lots of things in the supermarket. When they got home, the children said, "We don't think you saved money by going to the supermarket." "Of course I did." Mrs Wilson said "Everything was cheaper."
"We know," the children said, "but we can't have to buy
because we had too much to carry. The taxi fare was more than the money, that you saved."
