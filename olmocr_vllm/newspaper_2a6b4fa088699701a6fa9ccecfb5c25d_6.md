Conrad as A. melanoides is not the same species as that described by Minton et al. (2003). Therefore, we cannot with any certainty determine the status of either the specimen that Conrad (1834) first described as A. melanoides, or the entity that Minton et al. (2003) re-described as E. melanoides. Additional taxonomic work, led by the Smithsonian Institution, is underway as of early 2016. The results of this review will be published in a future edition of the ELIMIS spp. boundaries, status, and distribution within the Black Warrior River Basin.\n\nFinding\n\nThe Act only allows listing of “species” as defined under Section 3(16)—that is, recognized species, subspecies, or distinct population segments of vertebrates. Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information, and in light of the best available scientific information regarding taxonomic uncertainty described above, we conclude that the black maulida is not currently listed as a “species.” We are therefore removing the black maulida from candidate status pending further study.\n\nAs a result of the Service’s 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding within 90 days of publication of the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation, No. 10–377 (ECS), MDL Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011)), for all 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service’s November 16, 2010, CNOR. This document satisfies the requirements of that settlement agreement for the black maulida. It constitutes the Service’s 12-month finding on the April 20, 2010, petition to list the black maulida as an endangered or threatened species. A detailed description of the basis for this finding can be found in the black maulida’s species-specific assessment form and other supporting documents (see ADDRESSES, above).\n\nHighlands Tiger Beetle (Cicindela highlandensis)\n\nPrevious Federal Actions\n\nThe Highlands tiger beetle was first recognized as a candidate species on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), when we assigned the species an LPN of 2. In the Notice of April 10, 2003, CNOR (68 FR 54808), we changed the LPN for the Highlands tiger beetle from 2 to 5, because the immediacy of threats to the species by the shrubland habitat that had decreased with the acquisition of shrub habitat by the State of Florida and conservation groups. In May (sec. 5) 2004, the Service received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity and others to list 22 species as endangered, or threatened, including the Highlands tiger beetle. The species was maintained as a candidate with an LPN of 5 through the May 31, 2015, Cortez (see June 13, 2002 (67 FR 40657); May 4, 2004 (69 FR 24476); May 11, 2005 (70 FR 24780); September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53756); December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70194), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584)).\n\nBackground\n\nThe Highlands tiger beetle is endemic to the Florida shrubland and boulder ridge, and is one of the smallest (7.0–9.5 mm (0.28–0.37 in) tiger beetles in the United States is typical of other tiger beetles, adult Highlands tiger beetles are active diurnal predators that use their keen sight to detect movement of small arthropods and run quickly to capture prey with their well-developed mandibles (jaws). Tiger beetle larvae have an elongate white grub-like body and a dark or metallic head with large mandibles. Larvae are sedentary sit-and-wait predators occurring in permanent burrows flush with the ground surface. When feeding, larval position in the burrow mouth and quickly strike at and seize small arthropods that pass within a few centimeters of the burrow mouth. Larvae prey on small arthropods, similar to adults.\n\nThe Highlands tiger beetle occurs primarily in open sandy patches of the Florida scrub habitat on the Lake Wales Ridge in Highlands and Polk Counties. The Highlands tiger beetle is one of the largest and oldest Florida scrub ecosystems. The harsh environment on the Lake Wales Ridge is characterized by variable, nutrient-poor sandy soils, and (historically) frequent wildfires. The Highlands tiger beetle is often associated with evergreen scrub oaks, as well as high pineland with deciduous turkey oak (Quercus laevis) and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris). High-quality habitat for the species is primarily scrub or sandhill having natural or managed interdunal or upland with a high percent of open sand (greater than 50 percent) that is continuous or connected to adjacent upland with open, scrubby upland or paths. The known extent range of the Highlands tiger beetle exists in the central and south-central portion of the Lake Wales Ridge, approximately 90 km (56 mi) in length and about 10 km (6 mi) in width.\n\nSummary of Status Review\n\nThe following summary is based on information contained in our files. The Highlands tiger beetle is narrowly distributed and restricted to areas of bare sand within scrub and sandhill on ancient sand dunes of the Lake Wales Ridge in Polk and Highlands Counties, Florida. Adult tiger beetles have been found in 56 of the total 71 sites surveyed at the core of the Lake Wales Ridge. In 2004–2005 surveys, a total of 1,574 adults were found at four sites. A total of 643 adults at 31 sites were found in 1996, 282 adults at 31 sites in 1995, and 742 adults at 21 sites were found in 1994. A visual reference count of 2,231 adults was found from 46 sites in 2014. This increase in index counts over time can be used to estimate abundance and find a number of beetles at these sites. Estimates from the visual reference surveys provide an estimate of the populations. Results from a limited removal study suggest that the actual population size at some survey sites can be as much as two to three times as high as the visual reference. In addition, surveys for larvae have been conducted, but these are exhaustive, and there are additional potential suitable habitats. An estimate of number of adults can be obtained from these additional potential habitats added to the modified index count produces an estimated minimum total abundance of 10,438 adults in at least 16 populations. Based on these expanded surveys and the findings of additional large beetle populations, we determined that the Highlands tiger beetle is more abundant than previously documented, and its habitat is of much better quality than previously documented. Of the 15 sites with the largest populations, 7 sites show an increase in number of individuals. The number of occupied sites identified as high or good quality also increased from 1995 to 2005, to 21 in 2005. The 21 currently known sites nearly half of them (21 of 46) are of high or good quality."}
