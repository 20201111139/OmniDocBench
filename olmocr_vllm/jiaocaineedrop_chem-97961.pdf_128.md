The experiment did not disappoint!\n\nAs with salt, sugar has radically different properties (both physical and chemical) than its constituent elements. This difference in properties, of constituent elements and compounds, is a central feature of chemical reactions.\n\n**Contributions & Attributions**\n\n- Wikipedia\n\n---\n\n5.1: Sugar and Salt is shared under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by LibreTexts.\n\n- 5.1: Sugar and Salt by Henry Agnew, Marisa Alviar-Agnew is licensed CK-12.
