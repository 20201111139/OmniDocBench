Chapter 35).\n\nTitle: Alaska American Fisheries Act (AAFA) OMB Control Number: 0648–0393.\n\nForm Number(s): NA.\n\nType of Request: Regular submission (revision and extension of a current information collection).\n\nNumber of Respondents: 27.\n\nAverage Hours per Response: Application for AAFA Permit for Replacement Vessel, 30 minutes; Application for AAFA Cooperative Permit, 2 hours; Vessel Contract Fishing Notification, 4 hours; Application to be an Entity Eligible to Participate in a Transferable Chincoteague Chinook Salmon Prohibited Species Quota (PSC) Allocation, 8 hours; Application to Transfer Bering Sea Chinook Salmon PSC Allocation, 15 minutes.\n\nBurden Hours: 112.\n\nNotice and Uses: This request is for revision and extension of a currently approved information collection. In response to the American Fisheries Act (AAFA), NMFS developed a management program for Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI) pollock to include a set of permanent permits for AAFA catcher-processors, AAFA catcher vessels, AAFA inshore processors, and AAFA motherships. All vessels and processors participating in the non-Community Development Quota (CDQ) BSAI pollock fishery are required to have valid AAFA permits on board the vessel or on site at the processing plant.\n\nWith the exceptions of the inshore vessel cooperatives, replacement vessel, and inshore vessel contract fishing applications, the AAFA permit program had a one-time application deadline of December 1, 2000. All permitted participants in the AAFA pollock fishery are already established and are issued with an indefinite expiration date.\n\nIn a previous revision to this collection, a PSC limit of Chincoteague salmon was established for the pollock industry participants in an industry-developed contractual arrangement, called an incentive plan agreement (IPA) that establishes an incentive program to minimize bycatch at all levels of Chincoteague salmon abundance. NMFS issues transferable Chincoteague salmon PSC allocations to eligible entities representing the catcher/processor sector, the mothership sector, inshore cooperatives, and CDQ groups.\n\nTransferable allocations provide the pollock fleet the flexibility to maximize the harvest of pollock while maintaining Chincoteague salmon bycatch or below the PSC limit.\n\nRevision: The notary signature requirements have been removed from the Application for Replacement Vessel and the Application for Inshore Catcher Vessel Cooperative Permit.\n\nAffected Public: Business or other for-profit organizations.\n\nFrequency: Annually and on occasion.\n\nRespondent’s Obligation: Required to obtain or retain benefits.\n\nOMB Desk Officer: OIHO_Submission@omb.eop.gov.\n\nCopies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Jennifer Jessup, Departmental Paperwork Clearance Officer, (202) 482–0336, Department of Commerce, Room 6016, 14th and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20230 (or via the Internet at Jessup@doc.gov).\n\nWritten comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection must be sent within 30 days of publication of this notice to OIHO_Submission@omb.eop.gov."}
