North Carolina was home to a small and scattered population of farmers. The lack of good harbors hindered growth, and the colony had only 3,000 people by 1700. Eventually, the farmers began growing tobacco for sale. They also used native pine to make and export shipbuilding supplies.\n\n**South Carolina** The proprietors of Carolina were always far more interested in the southern half of their holdings, where they hoped to cultivate sugar cane. In 1670 three ships brought settlers from England to South Carolina. They named their first settlement, Charles Town, after the king.\n\nThe first years of the new colony were difficult. Sugarcane, as it turned out, did not grow well. The first product exported in large quantity was deerskin, popular for English leather. The colony also began to capture and enslave Native Americans, who were shipped to plantations in the Caribbean.\n\n**The Georgia Experiment** In the 1720s, General James Oglethorpe, a wealthy member of Parliament, began investigating English prisons. He was appalled to find so many debtors—people who could not pay their debts—behind bars. Oglethorpe asked King George II for a colony south of South Carolina where the poor could start over.\n\nThe English government saw several advantages to a new southern colony. It would help England’s poor and provide a strategic buffer to keep Spain from expanding north. King George granted Oglethorpe and his friends permission to settle between the Savannah and Altamaha Rivers. The new colony was named Georgia, in honor of the king, and the first settlers arrived in 1733.\n\nOglethorpe and his fellow trustees banned slavery, rum, and brandy in Georgia, and they limited the size of land grants. Still, the colony attracted settlers from all over Europe, including Scotch-Irish, Welsh, Germans, Swiss, and Italians. Increasingly the settlers objected to the colony’s strict rules. In the 1740s, the trustees lifted the restrictions on brandy, rum, and slavery, and in 1750, they granted the settlers their own elected assembly. The next year, the trustees gave control back to the king, and Georgia became a royal colony.\n\nBy 1775 roughly 2.5 million people lived in England’s American colonies. Despite the stumbling start in Jamestown, the English had succeeded in building a large and prosperous society on the east coast of North America.\n\nEngland’s success, however, would prove its undoing. By permitting new patterns of land ownership and new types of worship and government in its colonies, the English government had planted the seeds of rebellion.\n\n**Reading Check** Summarizing In what ways was England permissive with its American colonies?\n\n### Section 3 Assessment\n\n#### Checking for Understanding\n1.

In political organization, what was a trait of the English colonies that the French and Spanish colonies did not share?\n\n#### Writing About History\n8. **Persuasive Writing** Imagine you have been hired by the proprietors of New Jersey to persuade settlers to come to their colony. Write an editorial for a newspaper in England to convince people to settle in New Jersey."}
