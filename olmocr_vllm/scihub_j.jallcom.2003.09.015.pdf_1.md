This fact indicates that no homogeneity ranges exist for the ternary compounds.\n\nThe ternary compounds Ln$_2$Ni$_{15}$B$_{10}$ where Ln = Y, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho with the Th$_2$Ni$_{15}$B$_{10}$ structure type were reported in [12]. We prepared the sample of the composition Er$_2$Ni$_{15}$B$_{10}$ to verify the formation of the boride with the same structure in the Er–Ni–B system. But the powder diffraction pattern of this sample contained the lines of three binary compounds (ErB$_4$ + ErB$_{12}$ + NiB), which indicates the absence of the ternary boride Er$_2$Ni$_{15}$B$_{10}$ in the Er–Ni–B system (Table 2).\n\nA compound of the composition ErNi$_4$B$_4$ was reported to crystallize with two different structures: ErNi$_4$B$_4$ [13] and YCrB$_4$ [14]. This can indicate the existence of polymorphism for this boride. Taking into account that the boride with the ErNi$_4$B$_4$ type structure was found by a single-crystal method, and that the boride with the YCrB$_4$ type structure was found by X-ray powder diffraction, we assumed the high-temperature modification to have the ErNi$_4$B$_4$ structure and the low-temperature modification to have the YCrB$_4$ structure. The results of a DTA investigation revealed a transition temperature of 1540 K.\n\nA new compound of the approximate composition ErNi$_8$B$_2$ with unknown structure was found. The X-ray powder pattern of this compound differed from the powder patterns of the known ternary borides found in the earlier studied Ln–Ni–B systems. This compound exists only in the as-cast sample and decomposes into the Er$_2$Ni$_{15}$B$_{10}$ and ErNi$_4$B$_4$ compounds after annealing. Since the single crystals were not available its structure was not determined.\n\nA further new compound was found in the as-cast samples containing 16.6 at.% Er. The X-ray powder pattern of this compound was very similar to the powder pattern of the ErNi$_4$B$_4$ boride. The crystal structure of the new Er$_{0.917}$Ni$_{4.09}$B$_2$ boride was determined using an X-ray single-crystal method: space group P6/mmm; $a = 1.48399$ nm; $c = 0.69194$ nm [15]. This structure is very similar to the Y$_{0.915}$Ni$_{4.13}$B$_2$ structure [16]. The Er$_{0.917}$Ni$_{4.09}$B$_2$ boride decomposes after annealing, and the main phase is the ErNi$_4$B compound.\n\nAccording to our data, the Er$_4$Ni$_{29}$B$_{10}$ boride has the correct composition ErNi$_7$B$_3$; space group I4$_1$/amd; $a =$\n\n![Fig. 1.
