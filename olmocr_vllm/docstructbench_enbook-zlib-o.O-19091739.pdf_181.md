We must find the field contribution from a small element of current and then integrate over the current distribution from \\( \\theta_1 \\) to \\( \\theta_2 \\), as shown in Figure 29.3b.\n\n**Analyse** Let's start by considering a length element \\( d\\mathbf{s} \\) located a distance \\( r \\) from \\( P \\). The direction of the magnetic field at point \\( P \\) due to the current in this element is out of the page because \\( d\\mathbf{s} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\) is out of the page. In fact, because all the current elements \\( I\\,d\\mathbf{s} \\) lie in the plane of the page, they all produce a magnetic field directed out of the page at point \\( P \\). Therefore, the direction of the magnetic field at point \\( P \\) is out of the page and we need only find the magnitude of the field. We place the origin at \\( O \\) and let point \\( P \\) be along the positive \\( y \\) axis, with \\( \\hat{k} \\) being a unit vector pointing out of the page.\n\nFrom the geometry in Figure 29.3a, we can see that the angle between the vectors \\( d\\mathbf{s} \\) and \\( \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\) is \\( \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta \\right) \\) radians.\n\nEvaluate the cross product in the Biot–Savart law:\n\n\\[\nd\\mathbf{B} = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\right) \\frac{I}{r^2} \\mathbf{k}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute into Equation 29.1:\n\n\\[\nd\\mathbf{B} = \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi} \\right) \\frac{dx \\cos \\theta}{r^2} \\mathbf{k}\n\\]\n\nFrom the geometry in Figure 29.3a, express \\( r \\) in terms of \\( \\theta \\):\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{a}{\\cos \\theta}\n\\]\n\nNotice that \\( \\tan \\theta = -x/a \\) from the right triangle in Figure 29.3a (the negative sign is necessary because \\( d\\mathbf{s} \\) is located at a negative value of \\( x \\)) and solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = -a \\tan \\theta\n\\]\n\nFind the differential \\( dx \\):\n\n\\[\ndx = -\\frac{a \\, d\\theta}{\\cos^2 \\theta}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute Equations (2) and (3) into the magnitude of the field from Equation (1):\n\n\\[\ndB = -\\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi} \\right) \\left( -\\frac{a \\, d\\theta}{\\cos^2 \\theta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\cos^2 \\theta}{a^2} \\right) \\cos \\theta = -\\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi a} \\right) \\cos \\theta \\, d\\theta\n\\]\n\nIntegrate Equation (4) over all length elements on the wire, where the subtending angles range from \\( \\theta_1 \\) to \\( \\theta_2 \\) as defined in Figure 29.3b:\n\n\\[\nB = -\\left( \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi a} \\right) \\int_{\\theta_1}^{\\theta_2} \\cos \\theta \\, d\\theta = \\frac{\\mu_0 I}{4\\pi a} \\left( \\sin \\theta_1 - \\sin \\theta_2 \\right)\n\\]\n\nCheck the dimensions, noting that the quantity in brackets is dimensionless:\n\n\\[\n[MQ^{-1}T^{-1}] = [MLQ^{-2}][QT^{-1}]/[L] = [MQ^{-1}T^{-1}]\n\\]\n\n**B** Find an expression for the field at a point near a very long current-carrying wire.\n\n**Solution** We can use Equation 29.4 to find the magnetic field of any straight current-carrying wire if we know the geometry and hence the angles \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 \\). If the wire in Figure 29.3b becomes infinitely long, we see that \\( \\theta_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and \\( \\theta_2 = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) for."}
