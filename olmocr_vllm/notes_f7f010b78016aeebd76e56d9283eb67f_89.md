She looked carefully at the prices of things. She bought lots of things in the supermarket. When they got home, the children said, \"We don't think you saved money by going to the supermarket.\" \"Of course I did,\" Mrs. Wilson said. \"Everything was cheaper.\"\n\n\"We know,\" the children said, \"but we came home by taxi because we had too much to carry. The taxi fare was more than the money that you saved!\""}
