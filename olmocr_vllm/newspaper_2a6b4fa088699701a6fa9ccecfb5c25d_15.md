The sicklefin redhorse sucker likely experienced substantial range contraction associated with dam construction, losses of riverine and historical habitat degradation early in the 20th century, but the remaining populations appear to have stabilized within the past few decades and are successfully spawning and recruiting in four primary river drainages accessible from Hiwassee and Fontana Reservoirs.\n\nIn the future, we expect human population growth and land development to be primary factors affecting the viability in the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker. However, compared to historical land use effects, we expect the extent of these future activities to be minimized by more stringent State and local land quality regulations, such as are required by current regulations for land development and water quality, and a trend of diminishing agriculture in the area. Further, many current land use practices are likely attributable to the modern regulatory environment that provides protection for the stream environments. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1934 (USC 661 et seq.), North Carolina Environmental Policy Act of 1971, Clean Water Act of 1972 (33 USC 1251 et seq.), North Carolina Sediment and Pollution Control Act of 1973, Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as well as other regulatory actions, were enacted to control the effects of land development and pollution on the aquatic environment. Historical records indicate that the existing populations of the sicklefin redhorse sucker have persisted through significant agricultural land disturbance that resulted in considerable sedimentation of its habitat, indicating that the sicklefin redhorse sucker is likely able to tolerate moderate land disturbance. Rural development and growth of several small towns within the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker appear to be the dominant threats of land use disturbance. Rural development is limited in certain areas due to large portions of the watershed that are permanently protected. In the Nantahala and Chatuchoochee National Forests. The region is currently experiencing a trend of diminishing agricultural land use, indicating that widespread conversion to farmland is not likely. Commercial development is likely to be limited by a lack of large metropolitan areas or interstate highways that would facilitate rapid growth. The trend of high suspended sediment yield in the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker appears to have decreased over the last few decades. Increasing environmental regulation, greater public awareness, and actions of governmental and nongovernmental organizations to improve water quality conditions have resulted in considerable improvements in suspended sediment rates. Therefore, we expect existing regulations for land development and water quality to adequately maintain the habitat quality, and we anticipate that the species is likely to persist into the future even with the expected increase in development.\n\nThe sicklefin redhorse sucker is provided additional protection by State endangered species regulations and association with other federally listed species. It is listed as threatened by the State of North Carolina and endangered by the State of Georgia. Both States prohibit direct take of the species and the collection of the fish for scientific purposes without a valid State collecting permit. In the unimpounded portions of the mainstem of the Little Tennessee River and Tuckasegee River where the sicklefin redhorse sucker occurs, the species' habitat is indirectly provided Federal protection through the Act. In these areas, the mainstem portions of both of these rivers are designated as critical habitat for the endangered Appalachian elkhoe (Alasmidonta raveneliana) (a mussel). In addition, the Appalachian elkhoe, the portion of the Little Tennessee River where the sicklefin redhorse sucker occurs also supports populations of the endangered little-wing pearl mussel (Pegnia fabula) and the eastern spiny topfin club (Erinomysis monachus) and is also designated as critical habitat for the spotted salamander.\n\nSubstantial public land ownership in the watersheds occupied by the sicklefin redhorse sucker provides partial protection to the watershed. Approximately 43 percent of the land adjacent to waterways occupied by this species is owned by State and Federal agencies or by nongovernmental conservation organizations. On these conserved properties, land development is prohibited, providing protection to bullheads and potentially improving water quality throughout the watershed. Most of the land surrounding Hiwassee and Fontana Lakes is publicly owned, limiting shoreline development and protecting the near shore habitat used by juvenile sicklefin redhorse suckers. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has management jurisdiction over a portion of the lands within both the Hiwassee and Fontana watersheds, and tribal water quality ordinances protect habitat and water quality. Approximately 65 percent of the coastal Tennessee River is protected from development by inclusion in the Natchez Trace Parkway. The other three major spawning tributaries, most of the land is privately held and does not have restriction on land development.\n\nWhen the sicklefin redhorse sucker was elevated to candidate status in 2002, it was recognized as a distinct species. Only one other species, the sicklefin redhorse sucker, had been inadvertently introduced into the Hiwassee Reservoir, a major body of water in the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker. At the time, predation of young sicklefin redhorse sucker by blueback herring was an unassessed threat. However, a recent study examining the gut contents of blueback herring in the Valley River and Hiwassee Reservoir failed to find any sicklefin redhorse suckers among the samples. It appears that the sicklefin redhorse sucker and Tuckasegee River predation by blueback herring by spawning farther upstream than typical for the species has been mitigated. In the spring of 2016, blueback herring were collected from Fontana Reservoir, the other reservoir important for survival of the mainstem population. Further investigation is required to determine the degree of impact the blueback herring in the Fontana Reservoir poses to the sicklefin redhorse sucker, but the distance spawning sites upstream of Fontana Reservoir is similar to the distance in the Hiwassee Reservoir, suggesting that blueback herring will be similarly separated from the threatened sicklefin redhorse sucker fry during the time they are most likely to be present in the reservoir. Collections in the sicklefin redhorse sucker in 2014â€“2015 produced many young adult/lake juvenile sicklefin redhorse suckers that have clearly recruited since the herring invasion, even while juvenile walleye and white bass have declined in numbers since the invasion, suggesting that blueback herring is not preventing successful recruitment of sicklefin redhorse suckers. Therefore, the data and observations indicate that blueback herring have not proven to be a threat to the sicklefin redhorse sucker as an invasion species.\n\nMany of the stressors that may affect the sicklefin redhorse sucker in the future can be further minimized by conservation actions carried out under the recently signed OCA among the Service, North Carolina Wildlife"}
