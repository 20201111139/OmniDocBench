One possible version:\n\nNowadays, most middle school students have pocket money every month, and we did a survey in Class 1, Grade 9.\n\nAs the result shows, among the thirty students taking part in the survey, most of them often buy snacks; about a half spend their pocket money on books, and a few save some of it.\n\nHowever, things on me are quite different. I usually spend most of the money buying good and educational books which I think make me more knowledgeable. Only a small part is spent on snacks as most of the snacks are in fact unhealthy for us. And I save the rest against a rainy day.\n\nIt is true that we have more and more pocket money now.
