The Service did not publish any other notices of review for plants during this time period.7\n\n7 See also the reference to the various candidate categories in 1996, and *Panicum hirstii* was not included as a candidate species under the categories established in the Federal Register on May 7, 1996 (61 FR 57594, October 25, 1999). *Panicum hirstii* was included in the subsequent annual CNORS (such as the final LPN of 5 in 2001, 2002, and 2004 (66 FR 54808, October 30, 2001; 67 FR 40657, June 13, 2002; 69 FR 24876, May 4, 2004). The Service did not publish a CNOR in 2003.\n\nOn May 11, 2004, we received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity and other groups and individuals requesting that the Service list *P. hirstii* as an endangered species or threatened species under the Act. In 2005, the Service again made a warranted but-precluded finding for the plant, with an LPN of 5, but noted a change in its scientific name to *Dichanthelium hirstii* (70 FR 37770, May 11, 2005). In 2006 through 2014, *D. hirstii* remained a candidate with an LPN of 5; in September 27, 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 60934), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57797), December 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66630), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), and December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450). In 2015, *D. hirstii* was included as a candidate in the CNOR, but the LPN was elevated from 5 to 2, indicating a species with a high magnitude of imminent threat (60 FR 80584, December 24, 2015).\n\n**Background**\n\n*Dichanthelium hirstii*, as referenced in some literature, is a perennial, weedy, obligate grass that is currently estimated to occur in eight localities distributed across four States: New Jersey (Barkwoods Pond, Labouzky Pond, and Berlin Avenue Bog North in Atlantic County, and Hampton Furnace Pond in Burlington County); Delaware (Ashtabula Pond in Sussex County); North Carolina (Starrett’s Meadow and Lyman Road in Onslow County); and Georgia (Leslie Pond in Sumter County). A population is also present in Calhoun County, Georgia, is considered historical.\n\n**Summary of Status Review**\n\nThe plant that the Service has been referring to as either *P. hirstii* or *D. hirstii* has always had a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several changes to its scientific name as understanding about its distribution and morphology has evolved. The *Flora of North America* (FNA) is one source of information available to the Service and is considered the taxonomic authority for plants in North America because it is a comprehensive, systematic taxonomic account of the plants of North America. While several authors have published regional flora and descriptive accounts that recognize *Panicum hirstii* *Dichanthelium hirstii* as a separate entity, few have published critical treatments. The last critical taxonomic treatment was the 2003 FNA, which is a complete taxonomic treatment of the *Dichanthelium* genus worldwide. Within that genus, that explicitly relegates *P. hirstii*/*D. hirstii* to a synonym of *D. dichotomum* sp. roanokense (Ashe), which “grows on the coastal plain from Delaware to southeastern Texas and in the West Indies.” As a result, what is now *Dichanthelium hirstii* from the candidate list.\n\n**Finding**\n\nAs a result of the Service’s 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2014 (Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation, No. 10–377 (EGS), MDL, Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C May 10, 2011), for all 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service’s November 10, 2010, CNOR. This document fulfills the requirements of that settlement agreement for the Hirst Brothers’ panic grass, and constitutes the final 12-month finding in response to the May 4, 2004, petition to list the Hirst Brothers’ panic grass as an endangered or threatened species. A detailed discussion of the basis for the finding, including a complete review of the taxonomic history, can be found in the Hirst Brothers’ panic grass’ species-specific assessment form and other supporting documents (see ADDRESSES, above)."}
