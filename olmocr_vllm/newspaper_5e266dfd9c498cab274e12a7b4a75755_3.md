The bidder must contact its banker and grant permission for the banker to speak with EnergyNet about the bid allowance request. EnergyNet will not request the bidder’s account balance nor ask any questions about the bidder’s other lines of credit. EnergyNet will not request the bank account number, nor whether it can withdraw funds.\n\nPayments to the BLM will not be made through EnergyNet. At the conclusion of the bidding period for the final parcel, the bidder with the highest accepted bid during the open auction period (winning bidder) for each parcel will be provided instructions via email by the online auction system on how to make the required payment to the BLM. In addition, you will be required to pay a $25 fee to EnergyNet’s broker of 1.5 percent of the highest qualifying bid for each parcel purchased by the successful bidder. The winning bidder will submit a single invoice via email to each successful bidder for the total amount due. The BLM will verify the invoice for the amount due to EnergyNet’s broker.\n\nBidding will begin at the established FMV and increase in $10/pa. The maximum bid will be accepted for the parcel at the time the auction closes. The winning bidder will be notified via email of the successful bid, and the parcel will be removed from the auction. Each parcel will have its own unique open bidding period, with start and stop times clearly identified in the online auction system. Bids will be received until 11:59 p.m. EST on the day of the auction. Bidding has a 15-second countdown and the highest bid is displayed on the screen, allowing bidders to view and bid on the current highest bid. The online bidding period for each parcel will run for 24 hours from start to finish, and only the highest bid accepted during the period will be accepted. Bidding will close sequentially so that each bidder will know if it is the highest winning bid before subsequent bidders can bid. The website will display each current high bid, and the high bidder’s name.\n\nBidders are only permitted to submit maximum bids, which is the highest amount a bidder is willing to pay for the parcel. Participants are encouraged to participate in the online auction without having to be logged into the website at the time the auction period closes. The auction website provides a full explanation of placing maximum bids, as well as an explanation of how it works to place bids on your behalf to maintain your high bidder status up to the chosen maximum bid amount. The BLM strongly encourages potential bidders to review the bidding tutorial in the Frequently Asked Questions area on the EnergyNet website in advance of the sale. EnergyNet will declare the highest qualifying bid as the high bid. The successful bidder must submit a deposit of no less than 20 percent of the successful bid amount by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time, immediately following the closing of the sale in the form of certified check, postal money order, electronic fund transfer, bank draft, or cashier’s check made payable in U.S. dollars to the “Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management.”\n\nThe BLM will send the successful bidder(s) an acceptance of bid letter with detailed information for making payment in full. In accordance with 43 CFR §2353.3–1(d), the successful bidder(s) will forfeit the bid deposit if it fails to pay the full purchase price within 180 days of the sale. The BLM will make no exceptions. The BLM cannot accept the remainder of the bid price at any time following the 180th day after the sale.\n\nIf a bidder is the apparent successful bidder with respect to multiple parcels and that bidder fails to submit the minimum 20 percent bid deposit required in default on any single parcel following the sale, the BLM may cancel the sale of all parcels to that bidder. If a successful bidder cannot complete the transaction for any reason, the BLM may consider the second highest bidder to purchase the parcel. If there are no acceptable bids, a parcel may remain available for a future date without further legal notice. The BLM EYDO must receive requests for escrow instructions a minimum of 30 business days prior to the prospective patentee’s scheduled purchase date. There are no exceptions.\n\nAll name changes and supporting documentation must be received at the BLM EYDO by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 30 days from the date on the acceptance of bid letter. There are no exceptions. To submit a name change, the apparent successful bidder must submit the name change in writing on the Certificate of Eligibility form to the BLM EYDO. The BLM EYDO must receive the remainder of the full bid price for the parcel no later than 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time, within 180 days following the day of bid sale. The BLM EYDO must receive the following in the form of certified check, postal money order, bank draft, cashier’s check, or make available by electronic fund transfer payable in U.S. dollars to the “Department of the Interior—Bureau of Land Management” to the BLM EYDO. The BLM will not accept personal checks or other non-certified funds.\n\nArrangements for electronic fund transfer to the BLM for payment of the purchase price must be in place no later than 30 days prior to the payment date.
