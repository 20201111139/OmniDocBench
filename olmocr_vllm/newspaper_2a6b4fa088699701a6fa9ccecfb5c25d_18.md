This action is necessary to allow the 2016 total allowable catch of yellowfin sole in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area to be harvested.\n\nDATES: Effective October 6, 2016 through December 31, 2016.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Steve Whitney, 907-586-7228.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: NMFS manages the groundfish fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Regulations governing fishing by U.S. vessels in accordance with the FMP appear at subpart H of 50 CFR part 600 and 50 CFR part 679.\n\nThe 2016 flathead sole and yellowfin sole CDQ reserves specified in the BSAI are 1,617 metric tons (mt), and 16,933 mt as established by the final 2016 and 2017 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (FR 14773, March 18, 2016) and following revision (FR 64782, September 21, 2016). The 2016 flathead sole and yellowfin sole CDQ ABC reserves are 5,472 mt and 5,719 mt as established by the final 2016 and 2017 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (FR 14773, March 18, 2016) and following revision (FR 64782, September 21, 2016).\n\nThe Aleutian Pribilof Island Community Development Association has requested that NMFS exchange 80 mt of flathead sole CDQ reserves for 80 mt of yellowfin sole CDQ ABC reserves under ยง 679.31(d). Therefore, in accordance with ยง 679.31(d), NMFS exchanges 80 mt of flathead sole CDQ reserves for 80 mt of yellowfin sole CDQ ABC reserves in the BSAI. This action also decreases and increases the TACs and CDQ ABC reserves by the corresponding amounts. Tables 11 and 13 of the final 2016 and 2017 harvest specifications for groundfish in the BSAI (FR 14773, March 18, 2016), and following revision (FR 64782, September 21, 2016), are revised as follows:\n\n| Sector | 2016 Flathead sole | 2016 Rock sole | 2016 Yellowfin sole | 2017 Flathead sole | 2017 Rock sole | 2017 Yellowfin sole |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| TAC    | 66,250            | 161,100        | 211,700            | 64,580            | 145,000        | 203,500            |\n| CDQ    | 16,390            | 55,180         | 150,530            | 21,000            | 57,100         | 144,000            |\n| ICA    | 49,860            | 105,920        | 61,170             | 43,580            | 87,900         | 59,500             |\n| BSAI tawl limited access | 49,860 | 105,920 | 61,170 | 43,580 | 87,900 | 59,500 |\n| Amendment 80 | 5,552 | 12,023 | 5,639 | 4,663 | 9,405 | 6,367 | 5,534 |\n\n| Sector | 2016 Flathead sole | 2016 Rock sole | 2016 Yellowfin sole | 2017 Flathead sole | 2017 Rock sole | 2017 Yellowfin sole |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|\n| TAC    | 66,250            | 161,100        | 211,700            | 64,580            | 145,000        | 203,500            |\n| CDQ    | 16,390            | 55,180         | 150,530            | 21,000            | 57,100         | 144,000            |\n| ICA    | 49,860            | 105,920        | 61,170             | 43,580            | 87,900         | 59,500             |\n| BSAI tawl limited access | 49,860 | 105,920 | 61,170 | 43,580 | 87,900 | 59,500 |\n| Amendment 80 | 5,552 | 12,023 | 5,639 | 4,663 | 9,405 | 6,367 | 5,534 |"}
