Relative to this cost, the same error uncovered just **before testing** commences will cost 6.5 units; **during testing**, 15 units; and **after release**, between 67 and 100 units.\n\n- A number of studies indicate that **design activities** introduce between 50% - 65% of all errors during the software process. However, **formal review technique** have been shown to be up to 75% effective in uncovering design flaws."}
