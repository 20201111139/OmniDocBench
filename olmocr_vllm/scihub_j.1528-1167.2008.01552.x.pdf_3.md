Anticonvulsant activity and protective index of intraperitoneal AEDs in mice\n\n| AED       | MFS test | ED50 (95% CI) mg/kg | PI | ED50 (95% CI) mg/kg | PI |\n|-----------|----------|---------------------|----|---------------------|----|\n| Pentylentetrazol | >32.2    | 50 (23.9–87.8)      | 1.0| 50 (23.9–87.8)      | 1.0|\n| Phencyclidine  | >10      | 100 (3.6–26.5)      | 1.0| 100 (3.6–26.5)      | 1.0|\n| Valproate   | >125     | 63 (4.0–90.7)       | 1.0| 63 (4.0–90.7)       | 1.0|\n| Ethosuximide | >66      | 55 (9.3–99.5)       | 1.0| 55 (9.3–99.5)       | 1.0|\n| Phenytoin   | >3.3     | 1.0                 |    | 1.0                 |    |\n\n**Rota-rod test**\n\n- **ED50 value**: The dose at which 50% of animals show decreased motor activity.\n- **PI**: Protective index, calculated as ED50 of the test drug divided by the ED50 of the positive control.\n\n**Pentylentetrazol-induced seizure test**\n\nRank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal administration of AEDs in the pentylentetrazol-induced clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide >> valproate = ethosuximide >> phenytoin (Table 1). Phenytoin was ineffective up to a dose of 300 mg/kg. In slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant potency in this test with oral administration in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide > ethosuximide > valproate >> phenytoin (Table 2).\n\nOral rufinamide (≥1,000 mg/kg) and phenytoin (800 mg/kg) did not inhibit pentylentetrazol-induced seizures in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticonvulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.\n\n**Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced seizure tests in mice**\n\nIntraperitoneal rufinamide was effective at nontoxic doses in the bicuculline and picrotoxin clonic seizure tests (ED50 ~50–75 mg/kg) and showed partial protection from strychnine-induced tonic seizures (37.5% protection; Table 1). Overall, the general order of potency in these chemically induced seizure tests was phenobarbital ≥ rufinamide > valproate = ethosuximide > phenytoin (Table 1). In the strychnine-induced tonic seizure test, phenytoin had the lowest ED50 value, suggesting the greatest potency. However, it is important to note that 50% protection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Phenytoin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice.\n\n**Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice**\n\nThe median toxic dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide (TD50) in the rotarod test of behavioral impairment was 500–1,000 mg/kg. The TD50 for rufinamide was higher than that for comparator AEDs (Table 1), indicating a lower toxicity. Higher doses of rufinamide were not assessed due to the low ED50 values and high protective index (>40).\n\nNeurological side effects of very high-dose intraperitoneal rufinamide (1,000 mg/kg, n = 2; ED50 = 15–100 mg/kg) included decreased motor activity, ataxia, muscle relaxation, decreased respiration, and death (one animal died; the other appeared normal). Higher doses of the comparator drugs induced increased side effects (2 × TD50) and resulted in death (all animals) in 3–24 h (4 × TD50). The safety ratio for rufinamide in mice (TD50/ED97 > 19.2 [intraperitoneal] and > 23.8 [oral]) was consistently greater than for phenytoin, phenobarbital, and valproate (Table 4).\n\nThe median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required to produce loss of righting reflex in mice (HD50) was >500 and <1,000 mg/kg (Table 5). Rufinamide had a numerically greater HD50 value than phenytoin or phenobarbital (HD50 values of 178 and 135 mg/kg, respectively). Rufinamide, ethosuximide, and valproate had comparable"}
