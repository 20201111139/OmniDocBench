The resource ID of the `'DLOG'` and `'d1gx'` resources must be the same, and is passed in the first parameter of this function.\n\n- Using `NewDialog`, `NewColorDialog`, or `NewFeaturesDialog`, which take descriptive information passed in the parameters of those functions.\n\n#### Historical Note\n\nThe extended dialog resource and the `NewFeaturesDialog` function were introduced with OS 8 and the Appearance Manager. `NewFeaturesDialog` should be used to create Appearance-compliant dialogs. Unlike `NewDialog` and `NewColorDialog`, it has a flags parameter containing the same flags you would set in an extended dialog resource.\n\nIf NULL is specified as the second parameter in the `GetNewDialog` call, `GetNewDialog` itself creates a non-relocatable block for the dialog structure. Passing NULL is appropriate for modal and movable modal dialog boxes because you should dispose of the dialog box, and hence the associated dialog structure, when the user dismisses the dialog. However, in order to avoid heap fragmentation effects, you should ordinarily allocate your own memory for modeless dialog box dialog structures (just as you would for a window structure) and specify the pointer to that memory block in the second parameter of the `GetNewDialog` call.\n\nRegardless of which method is used to create the dialog, a **dialog structure** and a window structure will be created, and a pointer to the dialog structure will be returned to the calling function.\n\n### The Dialog Structure\n\nThe dialog structure created by the `GetNewDialog` call is defined by the data type `DialogRecord`:\n\n```c\nstruct DialogRecord\n{\n    WindowRecord window; // Dialog's window record.\n    HANDLE items; // Item list resource.\n    TCHAR text[8]; // Current editable text item.\n    SINT16 editField; // Editable text item number minus 1.\n    SINT16 editOpen; // (Used internally.)\n    SINT16 aDefItem; // Default push button item number.\n};\n```\n\ntypedef struct DialogRecord DialogRecord;\n\ntypedef DialogRecord *DialogPeek;\n```\n\nNote that the dialog structure includes a window structure field. The Dialog Manager sets the `windowKind` field of this window structure to `kDialogWindowKind`."}
