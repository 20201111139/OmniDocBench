We found no concentration of stressors that suggests that the species may be in danger of extinction in any portion of its range. Therefore, we find that the Louisville cave beetle is in danger of extinction throughout its range, and is not at risk of extinction at this time, and consequently we are removing it from candidate status.\n\nTatum Cave Beetle\n\nA review of the best available scientific and commercial information, leads us to believe that the Tatum Cave beetle is extinct, and, as such, it is not eligible for listing as an endangered species or a threatened species under the Act. Therefore, we did not further evaluate whether the Tatum Cave beetle is in danger of extinction throughout its range (an endangered species, likely to become in danger of extinction throughout its range in the foreseeable future (a threatened species), or whether the species is an endangered or threatened species in a significant portion of its range. Therefore, we find that listing the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum cave beetle as threatened species under the Act throughout all or a significant portion of their respective ranges is not warranted at this time, and consequently we are removing both species from candidate status.\n\nAs a result of the Service’s 2011 multi-distinct litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (in re: Endangered\n\nFinding\n\nLouisville Cave Beetle\n\nBased our review of the best available scientific and commercial information presented in the finding, we conclude that the Louisville cave beetle is in danger of extinction due to the following reasons: the species is an endangered species or threatened with extinction and/or impaired to a degree of its range that is limited to four caves. We evaluated potential stressors including human visitation and disturbance, commercial and residential development, sources of water quality impairment, and small population size. We found no concentration of stressors that suggests that the species may be in danger of extinction in any portion of its range. Therefore,
