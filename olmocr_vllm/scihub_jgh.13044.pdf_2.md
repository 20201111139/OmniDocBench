Compared with the subjects born in the non-exposed group, the odds ratio for obesity of the subjects born in 1961 was increased by 38.4% (95% CI: 1.101–1.738) after adjustment of age and sex. The odds ratios of being hyperglycemia are significantly higher in the subjects born in 1960 (1.293 times, 95% CI: 1.041–1.605), 1961 (1.321 times, 95% CI: 1.073–1.626), and 1962 (1.362 times, 95% CI: 1.156–1.604) than the non-exposed group. No positive association was observed in effects of Chinese famine on hypertension among total study population.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAlthough there is strong evidence from animal models that maternal nutritional status during pregnancy can induce permanent changes in the fetus, it is still not clear how this might apply to human populations. Our study adds to the literature on the effects of famine exposure in developing countries. In the present ecological study, we have found that exposure to the Chinese famine during fetal life and infancy was associated with a marginally higher risk"}
