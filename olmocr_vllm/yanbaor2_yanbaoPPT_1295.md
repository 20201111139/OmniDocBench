For example, brand was the top reason for the last luxury purchase among 68 percent of the post-'90s consumers, compared with 94 percent of the post-'65s/'70s consumers (Exhibit 4).\n\nExhibit 4\nBrand is important, but relatively less so among young consumers.\n\nTop reason for last luxury purchase by generation\n% of respondents who selected reason as no. 1 contributing factor\n\n| Reason            | Post-'90s | Post-'80s | Post-'65s/'70s |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|\n| Brand             | 68        | 72        | 94             |\n| Design/style      | 11        | 9         | 3              |\n| Fabric/material   | 6         | 8         | 1              |\n| Production process| 8         | 8         | 2              |\n| Price             | 7         | 1         | 1              |\n\nParticipants ranked these 5 reasons as a contributing factor for their most recent purchase\n\nNote: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding.\n\nSOURCE: China Luxury Report 2019"}
