However, NPS and BLM are signatories on the Conservation Agreement and actively involved in all actions that benefit the species. Each agency coordinates development of annual work plans and utilizes their authority to implement conservation actions that benefit the species. Federal authorities and regulatory mechanisms have successfully provided or facilitated conservation of the species.\n\nWe did not find any stressors examined under the Act’s threat factors A, B, C, and E to rise to the level of a threat that would cause us to determine listing of the erect leopard frog is warranted. Based on our review of the stressors combined with the beneficial effects that the various conservation efforts and regulatory mechanisms provided for the species, we find that the existing regulatory mechanisms (Factor D) are adequate to address the stressors currently affecting the erect leopard frog and its habitat.\n\nRegarding cumulative effects, there are also no stressors acting together to affect erect leopard frogs at certain sites. Overgrowth of vegetation, nonnative plants and predators, and disturbance by small mammals may adversely affect certain populations concurrently. Flash floods or wildfire may greatly affect a site at the same time as nonnative plants and predators. Reduced habitat connectivity adversely affects sites with small populations at the same time as overgrowth of vegetation, and nonnative plants and predators. Climate change may affect a site at the same time as habitat wildfire, and flash floods. However, after evaluating the cumulative effects, we conclude that the magnitude of cumulative effects to the erect leopard frog is low to moderate. Most stressors affect sites with small populations in a single geographic area due to the isolated distribution of most sites. Although individuals may be affected by more than one stressor in a single geographic area, there would not be population level effects to the species. The majority of stressors acting on erect leopard frogs may act synergistically, exacerbating effects greater than what may be observed by individual stressors. The effects of climate change may increase the number and frequency of wildfires and flash flood events. The presence of nonnative plants can make the effects of excess vegetation worse. Overgrowth of vegetation may close habitat for breeding, potentially making small populations smaller. Disease and nonnative predators such as bullfrogs, crayfish, and fisherae may also exacerbate the effects of small populations by removing frogs. We determined that symbiotic effects could occur, although they are expected to be low in magnitude. Most individual stressors adversely affect the erect leopard frog in a single geographic area, due to the isolated distribution of most sites. Although individuals may be affected by multiple stressors in a single geographic area, there would not likely be population-level effects to the species.\n\nTo minimize or mitigate effects from stressors affecting the erect leopard frog, the Conservation Team will continue monitoring populations and reintroducing frogs to sites should they become greatly reduced in numbers or extirpated due to the effects of one or more stressors.\n\nFinding\n\nBased on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act’s five threat factors, we find that the stressors acting on the species and its habitat, either singly or in combination, are not of sufficient imminence, intensity, or magnitude to indicate that the erect leopard frog is in danger of extinction (an endangered species) throughout all of its range, or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (a threatened species) throughout all of its range.\n\nPopulations of erect leopard frogs are improving due to past conservation actions and current efforts to restore and increase naturally-occurring and reintroduced populations. Current and ongoing habitat management, establishment of new sites, and restoration activities have made substantial progress since their inception and are continuing into the future. We have determined that the number of frogs and habitat conditions at individual sites change from year to year and may vary widely, but the rangewide status of the species is stable or improving.

Most individual stressors adversely affect the erect leopard frog in a single geographic area, due to the isolated distribution of most sites. Although individuals may be affected by multiple stressors in a single geographic area, there would not likely be population-level effects to the species.\n\nTo minimize or mitigate effects from stressors affecting the erect leopard frog, the Conservation Team will continue monitoring populations and reintroducing frogs to sites should they become greatly reduced in numbers or extirpated due to the effects of one or more stressors.\n\nFinding\n\nBased on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act’s five threat factors, we find that the stressors acting on the species and its habitat, either singly or in combination, are not of sufficient imminence, intensity, or magnitude to indicate that the erect leopard frog is in danger of extinction (an endangered species) throughout all of its range, or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (a threatened species) throughout all of its range.\n\nPopulations of erect leopard frogs are improving due to past conservation actions and current efforts to restore and increase naturally-occurring and reintroduced populations. Current and ongoing habitat management, establishment of new sites, and restoration activities have made substantial progress since their inception and are continuing into the future. We have determined that the number of frogs and habitat conditions at individual sites change from year to year and may vary widely, but the rangewide status of the species is stable or improving. In a single geographic area, there would not be population level effects to the species. The majority of stressors acting on erect leopard frogs may act synergistically, exacerbating effects greater than what may be observed by individual stressors. The effects of climate change may increase the number and frequency of wildfires and flash flood events. The presence of nonnative plants can make the effects of excess vegetation worse. Overgrowth of vegetation may close habitat for breeding, potentially making small populations smaller. Disease and nonnative predators such as bullfrogs, crayfish, and fisherae may also exacerbate the effects of small populations by removing frogs. We determined that symbiotic effects could occur, although they are expected to be low in magnitude.
