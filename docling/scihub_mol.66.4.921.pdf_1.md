vation is to increase adenylyl cyclase activity, although inhibitory effects also have been described. Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated tyrosine kinase-dependent sensitization of adenylyl cyclase catalytic activity, independent of changes in either receptor or heterotrimeric G-protein activity (Feldman, 1993; Tan et al, 1995, 1999). We suggested recently (based on pharmacological probes and the use of dominant-negative mutant of c-Raf) that the growth factorltyrosine kinase-mediated sensitization of adenylyl cyclase type VI involved Raf kinase-mediated serine phosphorin the superactivation of adenylyl cyclase after long-term opiate exposure (Varga et al., 2002).

In those previous studies, we generated several serine to alanine mutations of residues located in both the first catalytic subdomain (Clb regionmutating serine molecules at both amino acid residues 603 and 608) and in the fourth intracellular (IC4 regionmutating four serine molecules at amino acid residues 744, 746, 750, and 754) of 2001) These mutants demonstrated significantly reduced vanadate-stimulated phosphorylation and sensitization of adenylyl cyclase compared with wild-type AC VI (Tan et al. 2O01); however, the identity of ated phosphorylation was not determined. loop loop

kinase; 2) the specific amino acid residues in adenylyl cyclase critical for Raf kinase-mediated regulation; and 3) whether Raf kinase-mediated regulation of AC VI was generalized among other subfamilies of adenylyl cyclase isoforms. In the CRaf kinase and adenylyl cyclase in reconstituted system and have identified the single amino acids critical for this effect. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interaction is adenylyl cyclase isoform-selective.

## Materials and Methods

Mutagenesis of FLAG Adenylyl Cyclase VI. Six single serine and S754A) were generated via overlapping extension PCR mucarried out to generate a reaction used an upstream sense-mutagenizing oligonucleotides paired with a downstream antisense harboring a unique restriction used upstream sense oligonucleotides harboring a unique restriction enzyme digestion site paired with a downstream   antisense-mutagenizing primer. Each PCR product was resolved by agarose electrophoresis; followed by the Qiaquick PCR purification (QIAGEN, Valencia; CA). Equivalent amounts (50 ng) of PCR products from first PCR were amplified using extreme sense and antisense primers. The resulting PCR were purified and double digested with the terminal restriction enzyme; then cloned into pcDNA3-flag AC VI that had been digested with identical restriction clones were sequenced to verify the right open reading frame and right mutation pair pair

Our studies to date have demonstrated that tyrosine kiVI enhances the activity of the adenylyl cyclase enzyme (Tan et al., 2001); however, the molecular mechanism of this effect is unclear In particular, the specific form of Raf kinase that mediated adenylyl cyclase phosphorylation is unknown. In addition, the identity of the individual serine residues that are phosphorylated to mediate sensitization of adenylyl cyclase activity remain unknown whether this interaction is unique for AC VI or whether tyrosine kinase-mediated regulation is a phenomenon common to other adenylyl cyclase isoforms\_

Based on these uncertainties, we sought to determine: 1)
