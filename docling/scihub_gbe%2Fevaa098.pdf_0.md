## Abstract

Although the human Y chromosome has effectively shown utility in uncovering facets of human evolution and population histories; Here, we describe the high-coverage sequencing of the whole Y chromosome in a data set of 19 male Khoe-San individuals in ISOGG Y-chromosome phylogeny. Our results also improve the positioning of tentatively placed new branches of the ISOGG Ypastoralist eastern African migrations, B-M112 linked to earlier east-south gene A-M14 linked to shared ancestry with central

## Introduction

The male-specific portion of the Y chromosome (MSY) has long been regarded as an effective tool in the study and Kivisild 2007). It has proved useful mainly due to a lack of recombination   along it the  longest

haplotypic block in the human genome (Scozzari et al. 2012); and its paternal mode of inheritance. The transmission of an intact haplotype from father to son; changonly through mutation, preserves a simpler record of its history and allows us to study the male contribution to the shaping of humanity . ing
