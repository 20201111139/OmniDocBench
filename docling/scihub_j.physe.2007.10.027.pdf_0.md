## Abstract

The behavior of the linear magneto-resistivity Grx of the surface-state electrons (SSE) on liquid 'He exposed to the resonant microwave radiation is experimentally studied in the temperature range corresponding to the crossover between the gas-atom and the ripplon scattering regimes. The variation of near the microwave resonance is attributed to the heating of SSE induced by the absorption of microwaves At low complicated line shape of the resistivity signal observed at the intermediate temperatures is attributed to the interplay between two regimes.

## 1. Introduction

Experimental spectroscopic studies of surface-state electrons   (SSE) above  liquid helium   provide important relaxation phenomena. Such studies have been carried out with electrons above both liquid [1,2] and liquid He [3] The recent interest in such studies has been evoked by the theoretical proposal [4] that SSE occupying two lowest Rydberg states can be used as electronic qubits controlled by the microwave (MW) field. The motion of the SSE is confined to a series of two-dimensional subbands: while the motion perpendicular  to the surface is restricted to the hydrogen-like quantum Rydberg states; the motion along the surface is free except for the scattering from helium vapor atoms or surface capillary waves (ripplons). For SSE 3 above liquid which was used as substrate in our experiment; the crossover between these two scattering Under the typical experimental 4He He ,

conditions; the energy difference 421 between the ground and the first excited Rydberg states is much than T, therefore almost all electrons occupy the lowest state \_ The quantum transitions between Rydberg states can be by the resonant interaction of   SSE with MW radiation Recently, we showed that in the   gas-atom scattering regime the absorption of MWs of frequency 0 421 /h is accompanied by a strong heating of SSE caused by absorbed power and a very slow energy relaxation rate [5]. An important feature of this process is transfer  the excitation energy absorbed by electrons from MW field to the thermal energy of in-plane motion. An excited electron decays back to the ground state as a result of the collision with a helium atom Or ripplon. In   either case, the   energy exchange is negligible; and returns to the ground state carrying a large kinetic energy which is quickly redistributed among other electrons owing to the very high electron electron collision large large

The heating effects the scattering rate; therefore it can be observed experimentally as resonant   change of the electron resistivity. in the gas-atom scattering regime, E.g
