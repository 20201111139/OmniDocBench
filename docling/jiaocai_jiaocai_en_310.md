- 1 (209) Determine whether the following statements are true or false If otherwise a X in the bracket before the statement
- (a) Let L be any Then the number of equivalence classes respect to language L (i.e regular
- and |w|
- The language {"M" "w" |M accepts in less than 2016 steps } recursive.
- (d) The language {"M" M is a TM and L(M) is Context-free but L(M) is not regular} is not recursive.
- The language {"M1 M1 and are e but doesn 't halt on e} is recursively enumerable; but not recursive M2 Mz
- The set of all primitive recursive functions is a proper subset of the set of all J-recursive functions.
- Let A and B be two disjoint recursively enumerable languages. If AUB A B is decidable.
- (h) Let functions. If recursive H1o H1o
- Suppose SAT <p L and L â‚¬ P. Then P = NP .
