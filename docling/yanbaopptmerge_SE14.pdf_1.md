## What is a Component?

- OMG Unified Modeling Language Specification [OMGO1] defines a component as
- a modular; deployable; and replaceable part of a system that encapsulates implementation and exposes a set of interfaces
- a component contains a set of collaborating classes
- Conventional view: a component contains processing logic, the internal data structures that are required to implement the processing logic; and an interface that passed to it.
