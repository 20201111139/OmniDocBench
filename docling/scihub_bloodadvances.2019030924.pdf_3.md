*Pvalues to test differences in SIRs across NHL subtypes were computed likelihood ratio test derived from Poisson regression models adjusted for age at first primary NHL, sex and latency; with log of expected numbers of cases included as offset.

This risk after gastric MZL was similar across treatments (data not shown; SIR range; 5.98cancer significantly not after nongastric extranodal DLBCL (SIR; 1.32; 95% CI, 0.77 2.11), although the SIRs did not differ significantly (Pheterogeneity 12) Additionally; the SIR for stomach cancer was elevated among ondary analyses stratifying DLBCL survivors by HIVIAIDS status at CI,

most commonly occurring second cancers (liver and stomach cancers) evaluated SIR patterns by patient subgroup (Tables 4 and 5). In general; SIRs were largely and initial treatment of first primary NHL, but there were a few exceptions; For stomach cancer (Table 4), the only indication of borderline heterogeneity was by stage for MZL survivors (early 2.00; geneity were gastric MZL: For liver cancer (Table 5), the SIR among DLBCL survivors diagnosed before age 60 years was higher than that among patients diagnosed with DLBCL at older ages 1.21; Pheterogeneity 01) and during the first 5 years after DLBCL compared with later periods (SIR, 2.23 vs 1.32; Pheterogeneity 01). Liver cancer SIRs after DLBCL and MZL were significantly elevated only among males; but differences by sex were not statistically significant (DLBCL: SIR; 1.96 vs 1.48; 16) . Additionally; although there was no overall increase in liver cancer after FL, the SIR was significantly elevated highest among FL survivors who received initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy Pheterogeneity Pheterogeneity
