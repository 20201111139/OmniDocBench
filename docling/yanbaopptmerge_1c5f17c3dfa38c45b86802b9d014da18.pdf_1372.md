scattered from the object interferes with the reference beam; producing constructive and destructive interference As a result; the exposed film looks foggy; but close examination reveals a complicated interference pattern stored on it. Where the interference was constructive; the film (a negative actually) is darkened. Holography is sometimes called lensless photography; because it uses the wave characteristics of light as contrasted to normal photography; which uses geometric optics and so requires lenses.

Light falling on a hologram can form a three-dimensional image.  The process is complicated in detail; but the basics can be myriad exposed regions of the film are dark and block the light; while less exposed regions allow light to pass.  The film thus various directions; producing both real and virtual images of the object used to expose the film. The interference pattern is the perspectives; just as looking directly at the object would. The image thus looks like the object and is three-dimensional like the object. tiny

Figure 30.45 A transmission hologram is one that produces real and virtual images when a laser of the same type as that which exposed the hologram is passed through it. Diffraction from various parts of the film produces the same interference pattern as the object that was used to expose it.

The hologram illustrated in Figure 30.45 is a transmission hologram. Holograms that are viewed with reflected light; such as the white light holograms on credit cards; are reflection holograms and are more common. White light holograms often appear a little blurry with rainbow edges, because the diffraction patterns of various colors of light are at slightly different locations due to their different wavelengths. Further uses of holography include all types of 3-D information storage; such as of statues in museums and engineering studies of structures and 3-D images of human organs. Invented in the late 1940s by Dennis Gabor of the laser. Since lasers produce coherent single-wavelength light; their interference patterns are more pronounced. The precision is so great that it is even possible to record numerous holograms on a single piece of film by just changing the angle of the film for each successive image.  This is how the holograms that move as you walk by them are produced a kind of lensless movie for

In a similar way; in the medical field, holograms have allowed complete 3-D holographic displays of objects from a stack of images. Storing these images for future use is relatively easy: With the use of an endoscope, high-resolution 3-D holographic
