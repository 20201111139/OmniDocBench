other parts. The SEM pictures in Figure 6 show that the liquid preconcentrate exists as a separate phase   trapped into solid PEG 3350 clusters. Confocal Raman microscopy described in the next section showed a similar result   (Fig. 6c and d): two phases were detected with crystalline needle-like and irregular shaped domains of PEG in green) and liquid phase (visualized in blue) consisting of Capmul and Cremophor EL located between PEG 3350 domains. In separate experiments, hot-stage light microscopy studies (not described in this report) showed that the clusters and nodes disappeared upon heating to and   reappeared upon cooling below 50C.

## Characterization of Drug-Loaded Solid Microemulsion Preconcentrates by Confocal Raman Microscopy

The   compositions of the solid microemulsion preconcentrate with 49 and loads selected for further evaluation as potential dosage forms for I are given in Table 3 For comparison, compositions of prototype solid dispersions devel6 previously6 using PEG 3350-polysorbate 80 mixtures are also given in the table. drug oped

In combination with an optical   microscope; Raman spectroscopy can be implemented to map a specimen and to provide spatially resolved chemical information on the   underlying spe28-32 cies In recent years, progress in laser equipment,   development of  high quality holo-

One well-established technique for identification and characterization of the solid state of pharmaceutical   specimens is Raman spectroscopy. It is a robust and reliable method yielding information of high quality with a low limit of detection: In addition it requires minimal sample preparation and allows for high throughput 27 screening and automation

charge couple device (CCD) technology has led to an advent of Raman microscopy. Employing the principle of   confocality, modern Raman microspectrometers allow rapid chemical mapping with high spatial and spectral resolution. It is possible to reveal the exact composition and distribution of mixtures of stances and excipients at a resolution in the submicrometer range, at very low concentrations and at a pixel resolution of up to several hundred 31,33 thousand pixels. spatial complex drug

In the present investigation; Raman spectra of pure form were first collected (Fig. 7) and used as the basis for the deconvolution of the   experimental data cubes using classical least squares
