## Molecular Compounds

Molecular   compounds are inorganic   compounds  that take the form substances as water chloride (NaCl) Ionic compounds are formed when one Or more of their electrons to nonmetal atoms. The resulting cations and anions are electrostatically attracted to each other:

So what holds the atoms of a molecule together? Rather than forming ions, the atoms of a molecule share their electrons in such a a In a carbon dioxide molecule; there are two of these bonds; each occurring between the carbon atom and one of the two oxygen atoms. pair

Larger molecules can have many, many bonds that serve to sample of a given molecular large keep

## Naming Binary Molecular Compounds

Recall that a molecular formula shows the number of atoms of each element that a molecule contains. A molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom; so its formula is H20. A molecule of octane; which is a component of gasoline;

the suffix -ide. a molecule. Table 5.8.1 lists these numerical prefixes.
