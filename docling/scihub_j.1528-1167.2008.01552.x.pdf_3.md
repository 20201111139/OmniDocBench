## Pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure test

Rank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal administration of AEDs in the pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide valproate ethosuximide > > phenytoin (Table 1) slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant potency in this test with oral administration in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide > ethosuximide > > valproate >>> phenytoin (Table 2)

mg/kg) did not inhibit pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticonvulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.

## Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced seizure tests in mice

Intraperitoneal rufinamide was effective at nontoxic doses in the bicuculline tion from strychnine-induced tonic seizures (37.59 proin these chemically induced seizure tests was phenobarbi tal 2 rufinamide > > valproate = ethosuximide > pheny est potency. However; it is important to note that 50% protection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Phenytoin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice.

## Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice

(TDso) in the rotorod test of behavioral impairment was 500-1,000 mg/kg. The TDso for rufinamide was higher than that   for comparator AEDs   (Table 1), indicating lower toxicity. Higher doses of rufinamide  were not assessed due the low EDso values and high protective index (>40).

Neurological side effects of very high-dose intraperi n 2; EDso mg/kg) included decreased motor activity; ataxia; muscle died; the other appeared normal) . Higher doses of the com parator drugs induced increased side effects (2 X TDso) and resulted in death (all animals) in 3-24 h (4 X TDso) [intraperitoneal] and >23.8 [oral] ) was consistently greater than for phenytoin; phenobarbital; and valproate (Table 4).

The median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required to produce loss of righting reflex in mice (HDso) was >500 and < 1,000 mg/kg (Table 5). Rufinamide had a nugreater
