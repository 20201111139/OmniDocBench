In 1859, an Australian landowner named Thomas Austin released 24 rabbits into the wild for hunting: Because Australia had few predators and ample food, the rabbit population exploded. In fewer than ten years; the rabbit population numbered in the millions.

Uncontrolled population growth; as in the wild rabbits in Australia; can be modeled with exponential functions. Equations resulting learn techniques for solving exponential functions.

## Like Bases to Solve Exponential Equations Using

The first technique involves two functions with like bases. Recall that the one-to-one property of exponential functions tells us that, for any real numbers b, S, and T\_ where b

when the exponents are algebraic expressions. Therefore; we can solve many exponential equations by the rules of exponents to rewrite each side as a power with the same base\_ Then; we use the fact that exponential functions are one-to-one to set the exponents equal to one another; and solve for the unknown. applies using

7 32æ For example; consider the equation 34r To solve for 2, 3 side so that both sides have the common base, 3. Then we apply the one-to-one property of exponents by setting the exponents equal to one another and solving for æ:

342 7 3 7 322 31 22 = 6 1 = 3

Use the division property of exponents Apply the one-to-one property of exponents Subtract 2x andadd 7 to both sides

Divide by 3
