the groundwater. Based on these measurements, gradient in chlorendic acid pollution was observed (Figure 1) In March 2013, 24 4-m X (Populus trichocarpa X Populus deltoides)] were planted on the field for future phytoremediation were distributed over defined rectangular m by 35 enclosing   the area with   the highest concentrations of chlorendic acid in the groundwater (> 100 mg 1-1) (Figure 1) In fungal  strains of common bent and hybrid poplar. Four soil samples were taken in a 1-m perimeter around observation wells 0W175-4 surface soil, and m Common bent   rhizosphere and roots were inside the 1-m perimeter around each of the observation wells. Poplar rhizosphere and root samples were taken from three trees growing in the zones with high concentrations of chlorendic acid (Figure 1). From each tree; four sample repetitions were taken. In total, 32 soil samples were collected (4 x 4 depths x 2 locations) , 8 bentgrass   root and rhizosphere samples (4 X 2 locations) and 12 poplar rhizosphere and root samples (4 X 3 trees) Soil samples were taken with sterile tools and transported in sterile Roots were collected with soil particles still adhering to the surface, which was considered the rhizosphere fraction For poplar; the tertiary fine roots were selected. Roots with adhering rhizosphere fraction were obtained with sterile tools and directly transferred into falcon tubes with 30 ml sterile 10 mM MgSO4long grid bags.

## Isolation of Bacteria and Fungi

Soil samples were homogenized and vortexed in sterile 10 mM MgSO4 to isolations. Root and rhizosphere samples were The resulting soil after   centrifugation (15 min; 2700g) were surface prior pellet

sterilized by immersing them for 5 min in 1% NaClO and bunchgrass roots were sterilized with 0.1% NaClO supplemented with 0.1% Tween. Following treatment; all roots were rinsed four times in sterile distilled water. The last rinsing solution was plated on 869 medium (Mergeay et al , 1985) to confirm surface sterility by scoring microbial growth after 7 of incubation at 10 mM MgSO4 and mixed for 1 min mixer (Kinematica A6). days using

Every 10 10 ml of the culture was transferred into 90 ml of 60 mg 1-1 chlorendic acid after 3 months of incubation at 30'C and 120 rpm. At the end of the experiment; chlorendic acid concentrations were determined sur viving bacterial strains were purified and stored in a glycerol solution [15% (w:v) glycerol; 0.85% (w:v) NaCl] at For soil days; using
