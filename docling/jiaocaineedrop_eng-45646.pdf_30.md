## Likelihood of Occurrence

Likelihood of occurrence can be decomposed into two main components: threat and vulnerability. Threat is any circumstance Or event that has the potential to adversely impact our Threat can be adversarial (purposely caused by a person) or nonVulnerability represents a weakness in an information system that can be exploited, often by adversarial threat actor. system. an

Not all vulnerabilities are equal, there are factors that we can assess 4 vulnerability with. The risk assessment team will ask and answer questions such as (OWASP):

- (Discoverable) How easy is it for an adversary to discover the vulnerability?
- (Exploitable) How easy is it for an adversary to exploit the vulnerability?
- (Detectable) How likely is an exploit to be detected?
- (Awareness) How well known is the vulnerability?

Just as vulnerabilities, threats are also assessed various factors. The risk assessment team will ask and answer questions such as (OWASP): using

- (Capability) How technically skilled is an adversary?
- (Opportunity) Does the adversary the resources (technology) to exploit a vulnerability? have
- (Intent) How motivated is an adversary to find and exploit a vulnerability?
- (Opportunity) Is the adversary in a position to exploit a vulnerability?
- (Intent) Does the actor performing the exploit intend harm?
