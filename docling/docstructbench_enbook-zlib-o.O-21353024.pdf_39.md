straight to the manufacturer's website can save you lots of time. Most components a date code which used to be year and week (like 8634) but these days can be cryptic batch codes. (In the old could be a puzzler') have they days;

If you have a few components of one type; look for a code that's the same on all of them that will be the part number; the other codes will be date or batch codes of no interest.

Values on passive components are either shown directly (like 47 pF) (being the number of zeros) on the component. So SMD inductors picofarads A tantalum capacitor labelled 227 is 22 * 107 pF = 220 HF Some components may have five or six of colour code; but the Internet is a great help in decoding these rings

Most small SMD capacitors are not marked at all, so use your compo nent test skills and equipment to verify them: And get a magnifying glass or a USB microscope (which is what used to take most of the photos for this article) it makes it much easier to see the writing on small components. tiny

The internet has many resources to assist you for "IC Manufac turers logos' or "SMD codes" if you need more information And look 2-number plus 1-letter code. search

## Consider the Context

audio board is more likely to have op-amps.

## Don't Expect to Identify Everything!

stubbornly refused to be identified. SMD components can be difficult or impossible to identify; as they often have shortened part numbers on them Even bag have they

Imentioned the boards got as a kid, with bent-over component leads. religiously unsoldered all of them. These components unless are really special; its not worth the effort. days they

Electrolytic capacitors should always be tested; especially large power supply types; and look for domes on the a dead giveaway that have or leaky they dry gone

Older components such as carbon resistors are really not worth for their ratings; than modern types.

modern SMD ICs very fine pitch leads or are ball-grid array (BGA) types which need specialized equipment to install and remove Many have

If you think it might be something you can use; identify it to be sure before you g0 to the trouble of unsoldering it.

able to identify and use components from old boards can well repay the time you spend doing it. You can get high-quality compo nents and if you store them systematically; you can often avoid having to parts for a project; In addition; you can often use these skills when attempting repairs on circuit boards.
