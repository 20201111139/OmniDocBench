Large 0 (Strong Field)

Sigma and pi donors are typically involved in weak field interactions, which is field means that iron's d-electrons will occupy the higher energy orbitals; and won't up. weak pair

Ligand field stabilization energy (LFSE) can suggest the preferred geometry of an ion: The LFSE is calculated the equation LFSE = -0.4x + 0.6y, where x is equal to the number of electrons in lower energy orbitals, and y is equal to the number of electrons in higher energy orbitals. Iron (III) has a LFSE of zero, which means there is no other ligand position that would provide a lower LFSE, and so iron is able to form stable bonds in any geometry configuration: Usually d metal ions form an octahedral complex However, in the case of lactoferrin; the carbonate ion causes a slight change in the geometry which results in a distorted octahedral configuration. using

Figure 7: The difference between d-orbitals in metal ions is which influences their electron spin. If Ao is small, then it requires up; but when Ao is the jump into the next orbital would be too high. Note that this only impacts d4-d7 electrons . large, pair
