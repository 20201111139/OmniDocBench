The chemical compositions of the iron-rich intermetallics in Alloy B in the as-cast and SHTed (for 8 hours) conditions measured by SEM-EDS are shown in It can detected in the a-Fe and STed ß-Fe after SHT than the corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from the liquid. This can be attributed to the partial contribution of the surrounding Al matrix due to the small sizes of the fragmented a-Fe and after SHT. Compared with the as-cast condition; it can

SHT for 8 hours. As shown in Figure 2(c), however, the EBSD results with a mean angular deviation (MAD) of lower than 0.7 which is considered to be critical for an accurate solution,[31] indicate that this phase is and as the  platelet-like intermetallic phase formed during the SHT has a similar chemical composition to the ß-Fe obtained in the as-cast condiformed ß-Fe (STed ß-Fe) to distinguish it from the ß-Fe directly precipitated from liquid metal during solidifica The formation of the STed ß-Fe is further a low MAD value of 0.258 as measured by The STed ß-Fe is most likely to have the same structure as the solidified ß-Fe (tetragonal with and b of 0.634 nm and of 1.488 nm However the STed ß-Fe has lower Cu content than the B-Fe (Table II), and the replacement of the Cu by crystal
