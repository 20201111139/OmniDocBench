## Electrocyclic Reactions

The sigma bond, either formed or broken; must be at the terminus of a pi system so that either the product or reactant must be a 6 pi reactions involve the forming/breaking of 6 membered 4 sigma bond highlighted in magenta. key rings, key

pi Electrocyclic Reaction

forming/breaking sigma bond: If the orbitals involved rotate in the same direction (both counterclockwise or both clockwise), the process is called conrotatory. If the orbitals involved rotate in opposite directions (one clockwise and one counterclockwise), the process is called disrotatory  These differences in rotation are critically important when stereocenters are formed or broken.

As illustrated below, treatment of the susbstituted hexatriene shown yields the cis product when heated but the trans product when treated with light. This can be explained by looking at the pi HOMO for each case For the thermal reaction; the HOMO is 3 which rotates in a conrotatory motion of the HOMO 4 psi psi
