## Extremes of Cold and Wind

Neptune's blue color is mostly because of frozen methane (CH4) When Voyager 2 visited Neptune in 1986, there was large dark blue spot that scientists named the Great Dark Spot, south of the equator When the Hubble Space Telescope took pictures of Neptune in 1994, the Great Dark Spot had disappeared but another dark spot had appeared north of the equator Astronomers think that both of these spots represent gaps in the methane clouds on Neptune.

planet in the solar system; reaching speeds of 1,100 km/h (700 mi/h), close to the of sound. This extreme weather surprised places in the solar system. Temperatures at the of the clouds are about -218C (-360PF). speed top

## Lesson Summary

- liquid interiors.
- The outer planets have numerous moons, as well as planetary rings.
- Jupiter has more than 60 moons including the four largest; the Galilean moons.
- Jupiter; by far the largest planet in the solar system; has bands of different colored clouds, and a long-lasting storm called the Great Red Spot.
- Saturn is smaller than Jupiter but has a large system of beautiful rings .
- Uranus and Neptune were discovered relatively recently since are so far away. they
- Titan's atmosphere is similar to early Earth's and the moon could harbor primitive life.
- Uranus is tilted on its side, probably because of a past collision with a object.

## Review Questions

- 2 Why are the outer planets called gas giants?
- 4. Name the Galilean moons, and explain why have that name they
