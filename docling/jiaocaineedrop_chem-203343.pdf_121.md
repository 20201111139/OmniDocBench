mol C 27.29 =2.272 mol C 12.01 g g C

mol 0 72.71 g 0 =4.544 mol 0 16.00 g

Coefficients for the tentative empirical formula are derived by dividing each molar amount by the lesser of the two:

2.272 mol C

=l 2.272 4.544 mol 0 =2 2.272

Since the resulting ratio is one carbon to two oxygen atoms, the empirical formula is CO2

## Answer

## Derivation of Molecular Formulas

numbers of atoms that compose single molecule of a covalent compound requires knowledge of both its empirical formula and its molecular mass or molar mass. These quantities may be determined experimentally by various measurement techniques. Molecular chapter on atoms and molecules). Molar mass can be measured by a number of experimental methods, many of which will be introduced in later chapters of this text

Molecular formulas are derived by comparing the compound's molecular or molar mass to its empirical formula mass. As the name suggests, an If we know the molecular (or molar) mass of the substance, we can divide this by the empirical formula mass in order to identify the number of empirical formula units per molecule, which we designate as n:

g molecular or molar mass amu Or mol nformula units /molecule (3.2.11) g empirical formula mass amu or mol

The molecular formula is then obtained by multiplying each subscript in the empirical formula by n; as shown by the generic empirical formula AxBy:

(AxBy)n = AnxBnx (3.2.12)

If the compounds molecular mass is determined to be 180 amu; this indicates that molecules of this compound contain six times the number of atoms represented in the empirical formula:

(3.2.13) amu 30 formula unit

Molecules of this compound are then represented by molecular formulas whose subscripts are six times greater than those in the empirical formula:

(CH20)6 = C6H12 06 (3.2.14)
