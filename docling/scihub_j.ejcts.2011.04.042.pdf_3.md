Of the 104 patients who had received an ambulatory blood pressure analysis during their follow-up period; 25 (18.4%) were hypertensive and receiving treatment for it analysis of freedom from hypertension from the time of hospital discharge to date of last ambulatory blood-pressure measurement, there was no difference between the three weight groups

## Secondary outcome measures

Data on postoperative RV function was available in 158 out of 161 patients. Thirty-eight patients (24%) developed RV failure: In the lower tertile group, 18.9% developed postoperative RV failure, in the middle group 24.5% and in the upper tertile group

## Extreme mismatch subgroup

There were nine patients in whom the donor-recipient weight mismatch was 3 or greater (5.5%). By the end of the follow-up period, there was only with 18.2% (23/126) for those with a ratio of <3 (p = 0.76).
