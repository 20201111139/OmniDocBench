## ETIOLOGY

Injury to peripheral nerve can occur by means of sev eral mechanisms: stretching, compression (i.e., sustained compression blunt trauma), friction; inflammation; or laceration\_ The clinical results of stretching or compres sion of the nerve vary depending on whether the insult has rapid onset or is the result of a gradual change. A sudden insult does not allow for any adaptive in the connective tissue of the nerve and is more likely to cause acute disruption of the nerve's blood supply or connective tissue. Conversely, the nerve can adapt amazingly well to a slow increase in tensile or compressive forces, such as that brought on by a growing osteophyte: 12 A classification of peripheral nerve injuries is presented in Table 25-1.13-16 change

## Mechanisms of Peripheral Nerve Injury

- Stretching
- Compression
- Friction
- Inflammation
- Laceration

Compression of the nerve can be caused by external sources Or by swelling (e.g., inflammation) with con comitant increase in   pressure in rigid   compartment (e.g., carpal tional] syndrome of the leg compressing the fibular A nerve can be directly compressed, deep
