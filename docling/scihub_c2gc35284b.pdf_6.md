Reaction conditions: aldehyde (0.250 mmol), and 150 'C on 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3, and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 catalysts; respectively. The reaction time was not optimization. GC yield or conversion based on aldehydes; the product was determined by GC-MS, and H-NMR-

bearing electron-withdrawing groups (Table 1, entry 4) afforded a better yield than those   bearing   electron-donating groups (Table 1, entries 2 and 3) when 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 catalyst was used, however, the employment of 0.6%Au/RMOF-3 (Table 1, 17 16) and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 (Table 1, entry 22 The A coupling   reaction was reported to the reactivity of aldehydes could be affected by the employed electron-withdrawing   groups   afforded a electron-donating group bound to the benzene which required longer reaction time with metallic Au nanoparti 11 cles as catalyst. Wei and Li reported that both aromatic and aliphatic   aldehydes were able to A coupling with the catalyst of AuBr;. They found that electron tron-rich groups bound to the benzene decreased the reactiv aliphatic aldehydes was caused by the trimerization of aliphatic aldehydes with   homogeneous salts and Corma that   benzaldehyde with   electron-donating groups react smoothly; while substitution of electron-withdrawing groups on the benzene decreases   the reactivity with the catalyst   of 14 Based on the above results, we may presume  that different oxidation states between 4.6%Au/RMOF-3 and 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 catalysts. entry sing ring ring gold Zhang ring (e.g,

With the catalyst of 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 , the reaction with secondary amines proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding as and morpholine gave conversions of benzaldehyde, whereas the diethylamine afforded a lower conversion This was probably due to the iminium ions generated from alicyclic amines and benzaldehyde which are more stable than that ated from dialkyl amine and benzaldehyde. good gener -

A variety of aromatic alkynes were coupled with benzaldehyde and piperidine in the presence of the 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 catalyst:. It was found that straight-chain alkyl substituted phenylacetylene showed decreasing conversion of benzaldehyde with increasing chain length; the conversions were 86. 70.6%, and 28.5% for entries 10-12) Clearly; when increasing the steric hindrance of it a decrease in was found to be   highly   affected by the steric hindrance of   the alkynes, which was probably ascribed to the limitation effect of (trimethylsilyl )acetylene   also afforded moderate conversions of benzaldehyde with 62.1% and 56.6%,  respectively   (Table   1, 4%, gave

The reusability studies of 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 , 0.6%Au/ 3 IRMOF-3, and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 were  carried out on the A coupling reaction of benzaldehyde; piperidine, and phenylacety lene The results are summarized in Table 2 The fresh 4.6%Aul
