- the reaction, or the orientation of the molecules when collide may prevent the reaction from occurring:. they
- 53. The activation energy is the minimum amount of energy necessary to form the activated complex in a reaction. It is usually expressed as the energy necessary to form one mole of activated complex.
- finding k at several different temperatures; a plot of In k versus T, gives a straight line with the slope
- Ea from which Ea may be determined. R
- 57.(a) 4-times faster (b) 128-times faster
- 61.43.0 kJlmol
- 63.177 kJlmol
- 65.Ea = 108 kJ
- 108
- =1 10-10
- (b) 1.81 X 106 (c) Assuming that the reaction is irreversible simplifies the calculation because day.
- 67.The A atom has enough energy to react with BC; however, the different angles at which it bounces off of BC without reacting indicate that the orientation of the molecule is an important part of the reaction kinetics and determines whether a reaction will occur.
- knowing the rate equation: Yes. If the reaction is an elementary reaction; then doubling the concentration of A doubles the rate
- 71.Rate = k[AJ[B]2; Rate k[A]3
