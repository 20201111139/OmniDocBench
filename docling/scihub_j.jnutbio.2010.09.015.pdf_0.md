## Proadipogenic effects of lactoferrin in human subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes

José Manuel Fernández-Real, MD, PhD*

## Abstract

Lactoferrin has been associated with insulin sensitivity in vivo and in vitro studies. We aimed to test the effects of lactoferrin on human subcutaneous and conditions. The effects of lactoferrin on adipogenesis were studied through the expression of different adipogenic and inflammatory markers, AMPK activation and Retinoblastoma 1 (RBI ) activity. The response to insulin was evaluated through Ser473AKT phosphorylation: In both subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes; ratio). In conclusion; these results suggest that lactoferrin promotes adipogenesis in human adipocytes by enhancing insulin signaling and inhibiting RBI and AMPK activities

## 1. Introduction

Adipose tissue is recognized as an endocrine organ that plays an important role in human diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. Adipogenesis can be divided in two stages: adipocyte commitment of cells and terminal differentiation to mature adipocytes: Adipocyte commitment under tissue culture conditions is achieved by cell confluency. Cells under high confluency can be further induced to become mature adipocytes by various adipogenic adipogenesis have been extensively studied. In particular, several key transcription factors such as PPARY and members of the C/EBP protein activation required for establishing the terminally differentiated state [1,2].

Lactoferrin is a pleiotropic glycoprotein (80 kDa) and a prominent component of the first line of mammalian host defense; acting on regulated in response to inflammatory stimuli [5] Lactoferrin is able to bind and buffer several pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as nents of the extracellular matrix [6]. This ability is associated with the putative lactoferrin anti-inflammatory activity, as demonstrated in several studies [7-10]. Lactoferrin also participates in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation [11,12] In primary osteoblasts, lactoferrin stimulated proliferation and differentiation and acted as a survival factor,   activating PI3 kinase-dependent AKT   signaling, osteoclastogenesis in a murine bone marrow culture [13]. Recently, we have reported that lactoferrin is associated with insulin sensitivity in vivo in humans and in vitro (increasing 473SerAKT phosphorylation) in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cell lines. We also showed that lactoferrin AMPK and Retinoblastoma 1 (RBI ) activity [14,15]
