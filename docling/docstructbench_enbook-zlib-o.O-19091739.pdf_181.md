Model We are asked to find the magnetic field due to a simple current distribution; so this example is a typical problem for which the Biot-Savart law is appropriate. We must find the field contribution from a small element of current and then integrate over the current distribution from 0 to 02 as shown in Figure 29.3b.

direction of the magnetic field at point P due to the current in this element is out of the the plane of the page, all produce a magnetic field directed out of the page at point P Therefore; the direction of the magnetic field at Pis out of the page and we need only y axis, with k unit vector pointing out of the page. they point \_ being

From the geometry in Figure 29.3a, we can see that the between the vectors ds and is angle

Evaluate the cross product in the Biot-Savart law:

dx sin| (dx cos @)k

Substitute into Equation 29.1:

dx cos 0 (dB)k k

From the geometry in Figure 29.3a, express r in terms of 0:

Notice that tan 0 ~xla from the right triangle in Figure 29.3a (the negative sign is necessary because ds is located at a negative value of x) and solve for x:

Substitute Equations (2) and (3) into the magnitude of the field from Equation (1):

## Solution

We can use Equation 29.4 to find the magnetic field of any straight current-carrying wire if we know the geometry and hence the angles 0 and 0 If the wire in Figure 29.3b becomes infinitely we see that 0 T/2 and 0 long'
