## Preparing Cities for Robot Cars

The possibility of self-driving robot cars has often seemed like a futurist's dream, years away from began giving permits in April for companies to test truly self-driving cars on public roads. The state also cleared across the country: Its hard to predict when driverless cars will be everywhere on our roads. But however long it takes; the technology has the potential to change our transportation systems and our cities; for better or for worse; depending on how the transformation is regulated.

Policymakers should start thinking now about how to make sure the appearance of driverless vehicles
