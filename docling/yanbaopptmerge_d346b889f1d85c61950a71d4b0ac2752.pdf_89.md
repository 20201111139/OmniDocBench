At nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker; and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is 34,000, and the equilibrium salary is nurse. In reality; of course; the market for nurses is actually made up of many smaller markets, like markets for nurses with varying degrees of simple product like gasoline comes in regular; premium; and super-premium; each with a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average price of gasoline; like the average salary for nurses; can still be useful because it reflects what is happening in most of the submarkets. Many

When the price of labor is not at the equilibrium; economic incentives tend to move salaries toward the equilibrium. For example; if salaries for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the equilibrium at S75,000 per At that aboveequilibrium salary, excess supply or a results. In a situation of excess supply in the labor market, with many otherwise would surplus they

In contrast; if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, $60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or 27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that pay to keep their own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train or in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again; price and quantity in the labor market will move toward equilibrium. work

## Shifts in Labor Demand

under the ceteris paribus assumption: A change in the wage or salary result in a change in the quantity demanded will decrease, and there will be movement upward along the demand curve If the wages and salaries decrease; employers are more likely to hire a greater number of workers. The quantity of labor demanded will increase; resulting in a downward movement along the demand curve. will

Shifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons One reason is that the demand for labor is based on the demand for the Or service that is produced. For example, the more new automobiles consumers demand, the greater the number of workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand for labor is called a 'derived demand. Here are some examples of derived demand for labor: key good being

- The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant meals.
- The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for prescription drugs.
- The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal services.

As the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to meet employers' production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand for labor will increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.
