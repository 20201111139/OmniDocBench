To construct pNI6 encodthe hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI with the amino-acid substitution mutated nlpI in the chromosomal DNA of Rev3 (spr-1 nlpI3) was amplified by PCR DNA was digested with the NcoI and inserted into the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct the truncated and hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI, the fragment containing the truncated nlpI was amplified by with NcoI, then inserted into the same site of pBAD as pNI7 except that 5'-CATCCAIGGCCTGGCCCAGG-3' or used as the reverse primer in PCR. encoding NlpI, the nlpI in the chromosomal DNA of W3110 was amplified by PCR the forward primer containing  the NcoI site (underlined) 5'-TGGGCCAT GGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and the reverse primer containing the BamHI site (underlined) 5'-TGGATCCGGCT CAAAGTAGG-3' . The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into the same sites of the same way as pNIIO except that 5'-CCAGGGATCCT ing using pNI7 Myc using

3' , or 5'-ATCIGGATCCTAGCCCAGGAG-3' , respectively; was used as the reverse primer containing the BamHI site (underlined) in PCR. The amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and BamHI and then inserted into

Expression and Purification of Hexa-Histidine-Tagged NlpI Protein~E. coli cells were transformed with the recombinant plasmids. The transformants were grown in taining 0.019 arabinose at 42*C for 4 h for expression of the fusion genes. Cells from 400 ml of medium were collected, washed once with ice-cold 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl (buffer A), suspended in 4 ml of the buffer A containing 10 mM imidazole and 1% Triton X-100, and disrupted by sonication with cooling by ice-water: The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 17,700 xg to obtain a clear lysate. Four milliliters of the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of nickelnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin and incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4C. The mixture was loaded onto an open column The column was washed with 4 ml each of buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole and then contain40 mM imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted with 1.2 ml of buffer A containing 100 mM imidazole, and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected ing\_
