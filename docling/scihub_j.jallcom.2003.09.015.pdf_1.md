- Compounds   were found only in the as-cast samples-

The   formation of solid solution regions for the binary compounds  was not revealed,  and practically no variation three-phase samples was observed (Table 2). This fact indicates that no homogeneity ranges exist for the ternary compounds.

[12]. We prepared the sample of the composition ErzNiB1o ture in the Er-Ni-B system. But  the  powder   diffraction pattern of this sample contained the lines of three binary compounds (ErB4 + ErB12 + NiB ), which indicates the ab-

sence of the ternary boride ErzNiB1o in the Er-Ni-B system

A compound of the composition ErNiB4 was reported to YCrB4 [14]- This can indicate the existence of polymorphism for this boride: Taking into account that the boride with the ErNiB4 type structure was found by a single-crystal method, and that the boride with the YCrB4 type structure was found by X-ray powder diffraction; we assumed the and the low-temperature modification to have the YCrB4 structure\_ The results of a DTA investigation revealed a tran sition temperature of 1540 K.

A further compound was found in the as-cast tern of this   compound was very similar to the der   pattern boride\_ structure new was determined an single-crystal method: space group Polmmm; a 1.48399 nm; ( 0.69194nm [15] This structure is to the The X-ray using X-ray

A new compound of the approximate   composition ErNigB2 with unknown   structure was found. The powder pattern of this compound differed from the powder patterns of the known ternary borides found in the earlier This  compound exists only in the as-cast   sample crystals were not available its structure was not determined.
