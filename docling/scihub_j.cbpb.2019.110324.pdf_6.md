2009; Tussiwand et al., 2012), indicating the functional conservation of these genes between mammals and teleosts evolution. atf7 was preferentially expressed in the brain as reported in the mice (Goetz et al., 1996). The expression pattern of atf7b not atf7a in tilapia was tilapia; atf7a was specifically expressed in the testis indicating its pofollowing duplication indicated neofunctionalization in atf7a as suggested   previously for some regulatory genes (Duarte et al., 2006; scription factor in human (Zhao et al , 2005), however, different from was highly expressed in the heart and atfSb showed low expression level in various tissues in tilapia. during

at different stages of development.  Generally, these periods represent four biological events during gonadal development of the tilapia: sex determination and differentiation at 5 dah, initiation of germ cell dah, and vitellogenesis in ovary and sperm maturation in testis at 180 dah (Tao et al., 2013). The ovary-enriched genes, crebla, jdp2b and atf4b, were highly expressed at 180 dah, while at relatively low level at with little difference between the ovary and testis, indicating crebl promotes apoptosis and decreases estradiol synthesis in mouse granulosa cells (Zhang et al., 2018). It was reported that jdp2 was novel negative regulator of FSH induction by gonadotropin-releasing tilapia; jdp2a and jdp2b were ubiquitously expressed in ovary and testis\_ These results indicated that in addition to its influence on ovarian detestis. Among testis-enriched genes, except that the expression of atf4b expressed the highest at 180 dah, followed by 90 dah, suggesting that these play an important role in spermatogenesis. Previous research reported that crem was highly expressed in spermatogenic cells and crem-mutant mice caused spermiogenesis deficiency and germ-cell apoptosis (Blendy et al., 1996; Nantel et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2018). Interestingly, in our study, signals of crema were also observed in the phase I and II oocytes of the ovary. Further functional characterization of these sexual dimorphically expressed ATF /CREBs transgenic over-expression and knockout strategies may help elucidate the exact roles of these genes in sex differentiation and gonadal development in teleosts, as well as in other vertebrates. key they genes using
