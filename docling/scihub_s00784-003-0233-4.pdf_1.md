The most common histological type was osteosarcoma (n=9; 289) followed by malignant   fibrous ' histiocytoma (MFH;(n=7 22%) , The\_histological subtypes of osteosarcoma were chondrob nos 1 3 4 and   telangiectatic (n=1, In   rhabdomyosarcoma; the histological   subtypes were alveolar   (n=3, 17 , pleomorphic (n=2 nos: 19, 21 ). Patients with malignant lymphoma were excluded from this study because malignant lymphoma is Two cases of plasmacytoma were both of the solitary type; therefore these cases were included.

Treatment was determined according to the experience of the lack of unity in the treatment protocol. The common agents were cisplatin (n=5) 5-fluorouracil (n=4), and doxorubicin (n=4). apy administered via the superficial temporal artery was given in 9 of 11 patients who had sarcoma of the maxilla; maxillary sinus, Or

the temporomandibular fossa. The survival rate and survival curve were calculated by the   Kaplan-Meier   method SPSS for using

## Results

Fourteen patients of 32 were making satisfactory progress without local recurrence or metastasis at a mean follow-up period of 8.5 years; ranging from 2 19 years. Local recurrence was found in 10 cases (319) and metastasis in 11 (349). Among 10 patients with local recurrence, 3 are alive after 6-17 years , and 7 died of their tumors after 5 months to 4 years. Among the 3 patients alive, one (no. 3) was treated by surgery and the other (no:. 17) by surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (50 alive without evidence of disease over 3 years and 7 years after salvage treatment. Another patient (no. 5) was treated by preoperative radiation therapy (45 Gy) and surgery for local recurrence. The local recurrence was controlled, but this patient developed distant metastasis to the Gy) lung

was 309 1). Among 11 patients with metastases 9 died

Surgical   resection (S) alone carried Triple modality of S radiation therapy (R) and chemotherapy (C) was performed in 6, combined therapy of SIC in 4, and SIR was in 4 were unresectable in three cases; therefore combined therapy of R and C was given to these 3 was postoperatively in 3 and both in 1 . The doses used varied from 18 to 80 Gy, with an average of 48 Gy. All radiation therapy was external were 2.5 Gy: treating 4 days in week. Chemotherapy was given   preoperatively   in 8 cases and postoperatively in 2 The chemotherapy regimens were varied
