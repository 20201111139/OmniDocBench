Table 6 gives the optimum design parameters and economics for the relative volatility cases considered. For the base case of = 2.00, the optimum opera pressure of the column is 9 bar. The bottoms purity of 98 mol % Cis achieved with a column of 55.06 mol/s. The total capital investment for the column reboiler, and condenser is X X 103 /yr. Assuming a period of 3 years, the TAC is $414.80 x the decrease of but   the is This decrease is reasonable because lower pressure helps the VLE There is an increase in the optimum number of total trays with the decrease Decrease of from 2.00t0 1.75 results in higher change in the number of separation trays. On the other hand, the increase in the number of reactive  trays is more remarkable for the case of = 1.50. The other variable reflux R and the vapor Vs increase dramatically as costs significantly higher as the value of decreases. ting 0390 boilup Payback change 0390 0390 design 0390 boilup 0390 get 0390

The results of this ternary differ significantly from those of the quaternary systems in terms of the actions of temperature controllers . The studies on quaternary   systems concluded that the the same action However, dynamically stable results are obtained for this   ternary   system with   temperature controllers pbysical explanation of this situation are given in a recent paper. system having

The main design   objective is to obtain the purity of the of reactants escaping from the distillate stream should also be considered This is especially important for the light reactant A, which has an identical volatility with the inert component I

cases. There is a temperature profile for the case of 0390 = 2.00. This is especially true for the stripping section: The decrease of the value of moderates the sharpness of the temperature The size of the hump in the reactive zone also sharp 0390 profile.

3.2. Ternary System with Inert Component. The flowsheet of ternary with inert is given in Figure 9. This one of them is an inert component 1 in terms of the reaction. Since its volatility is assumed the same as that of the light reactant A, it is fed from the fresh feed stream FAo as a mixture with A. The other fresh feed stream FBo contains pure reactant B. While the product â‚¬ inert removed from the distillate without in the reaction Thus, the column has three zones: a stripping section; a reactive zone, and rectifying section: It is assumed that the light and fresh feed streams are fed from the bottom and top trays of the reactive zone, respectively system system heavy boiling taking part heavy

Thus, a constraint of 3 mol % is defined for the maximum amount of reactants the column from the The liquid holdups in the reactive trays are selected as 2000 mols to have reasonable % I. Kinetic parameters of the ternary are given in Table 5. The basic design procedure is based on the paper in the 21 literature. leaving top. system existing

The optimization problem for the ternary with inert includes five design   variables. These are (1) the number of stripping trays Ns, (2) the number of reactive trays and (3) the number of rectifying trays NR (4) the column pressure P; and (5) the reflux R The objective function is TAC, and the same basis of economics is used as that has been used for the ternary without inert component. system system
