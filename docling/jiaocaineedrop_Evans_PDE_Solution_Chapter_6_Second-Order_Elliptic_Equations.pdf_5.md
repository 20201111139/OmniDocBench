- 10 Proof.  We omit (a) since is standard. For (b). if u attains an interior maximum conclusion follows from strong maximum principle.

Then Hopfs lemma implies which is a contradiction\_

## Proof Define

B[u; v] dx for u € i,j aijur

dx i,j = J (0(u) is bounded since u is bounded) i,j dx i,j i,j Ufj dx , Ufj

(We don t know whether the product of H1 functions is weakly differentiable. This is why two

- 12 Proof. Given u € U Since U is compact and

2 U aij u2 (Lu + cu)u since aij U Lu U U ~aijur;r; aijur; aijur; Urj Uri Uxj 02 uLv

Therefore;

Mw : = -aij + a'j2 Lu "Lv < 0 {x € U : " > 0} € U U U u2

0 0 < maX W max W = =0 {u>0} U

Hence u < 0 in U.
