sideways total aerosol application time was approximately 2-5 min; followed by 1-h exposure period. After the 1-h exposure; the air ventilation system was turned on for approximately 10 min to remove any residual aerosol particles that may be present in the ambient aic: The next step was to pick up all bioassay arenas that were exposed to the aerosol insecticide treatment and replace with new bioassay arenas for the next aerosol treatment, which took approximately 5-15 min. The aerosol application position was changed after each treatment and each aerosol application location was repeated twice for each aerosol formulation. logis tical constraints of the milling facility (time available for and + pyriproxyfen methoprene aerosol treatments. 1 of testing had five trials, day 2 had six trials, and 3 had five trials; for a total of 16 aerosol applications. using Due testing) Day day

## Bioassays

The T. confusum larvae used in the study were from a pesticidesusceptible strain maintained Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service-Center for Grain and Animal   Health Tribolium  confusum colonies are reared 95% organic whole(L:D) h in an environmental

Testing arenas used in this study were individual 60 X 15 mm side larger 150 * 20 mm (~137 cm? dishes were driveway patching material   (Rockite, Hartline Product Inc Cleveland, OH) was mixed with water to create a thin poured in the bottom of Petri dishes to a depth of ~0.5 cm; and held at ambient conditions for approximately 7 d. Inside each Petri dish, four concrete arenas were placed\_ Three of the arenas were used in the current study for residual bioassays at 2, 4, and 6 wk post-aerosol treatment and contained no diet at time of exposure to aerosol. The other arena was used as described by Scheff et al. (2018). Co., slurry

These groups of testing arenas were placed at ten different tions on the third floor (Fig. 1). Nine positions also had aerodynamic particle sizer units (APS 3321, TSI Shoreview; MN) placed to collect data on aerosol particle concentration and size distribution. posi Inc.,

Two additional testing arenas were placed on the first floor of the mill each aerosol treatment and served as untreated controls\_ Arenas were placed in each of the four major corners of the mill floor (arenas 4, 5, 8, 10). Bioassay arenas along walls were placed Bioassay arena equipment and pneumatic conveying ducts. Bioassay arena was placed underneath a of milling equipment. Relative to the ap plication locations, bioassay arena 1 was aerosol application location 1 and bioassay arenas 9 and 4 were placed next to aerosol application locations 2 and 3, respectively. during large piece

After aerosol applications; each bioassay arena was covered and transported back to the USDA-ARS-CGAHR and held at 27 C,60% lution to evaluate IGR effects on development. Larvae were examined twice weekly; up to 4 wk, for adult emergence. Emerged adults were removed from dishes to prevent cannibalism\_

At the end of 4 wk, all five individuals were classified as larvae, pupae, or adults . Means and SEs were calculated for adult emergence and data analyzed statistical analysis software (version 9.4, SAS Institute, NC). Adult emergence data were transformed to values prior to analysis 'Zar 2010) before three-way and residual week as the main effects. using Cary, angular using

## Aerosol Dispersal Patterns

To assess  the strength of the effect of the aerosol application; an efficacy value index was created to convert the three   morphoefficacy response with five adults; to five larvae. All of the index values with the corresponding numbers following: 1 [1,1,3], 15 [1,0,4], 16 [0,5,0], 17 [0,4,1], 18 [0,3,2], 19 [0,2,3], 20 21,
