## RESULTS

## Validation Tests

process, several validation tests were car ried out in order to ensure the reliability and discriminant validity of the instruments. For instance; Cronbach alpha test was performed on the items of each construct to ensure the validity of the questionnaire and its internal consistency. The reliability of items in each construct ranged from 0.74 for behavioral intention to 0.92 for perceived ease of use (Table 1), which exceeded the standard suggested by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994). Therefore, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was within an acceptable range.

construct than any other construct. According to Fornell and Larcker (1981), this result represents satisfactory  level of discriminate validity and convergence.

## Sample

As mentioned  previously;  the   questionnaire was distributed by e-mail to people who work in information   technology   organizations   in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A total of 171 completed surveys were received and used for analysis. Seventy-three percent of respondents were male and the majority of the respondents were between 20 and 35 years old. Table 3 shows a descriptive analysis of sample characteristics . aged

The first five hypotheses (i.e., hypothesis 1-5) TAM constructs (PU, PEU, AT and BI) while tested the effect of the external variables (age, on attitudes towards cloud computing in Saudi linear regression was on the obtained data. The results are presented in Table 4 potheses 1 and 2 tested the effects of PU and ganizations respectively Moreover; hypotheses 6,7,8, 9 and 10 tested the effect of gender; age; education; job domain and nationality on the respectively. Entering all variables in oneblock, the results presented a significant percentage of variance 62% (R2=0.65, F (7,163) = 37.92, applied Hy-

Furthermore, factor analysis was carried out in order to test the convergent and discriminant validity of the instrument (question naire). A total of 28 items were analyzed at the perceived ease of use, attitude and behavioral forthe factoranalysis principalcomponent analysis as an extraction method and Varimax using
