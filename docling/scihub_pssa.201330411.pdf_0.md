- 1 Introduction Despite the progress made in the field research are necessary for a substantial breakthrough in commercializa stability of the devices are still one of Usually , luminance degradation and an increase in operating voltage with   prolonged electrical   driving are typical features of electrical fatigue in polymer-based OLEDs [4]. Thereby the device lifetime is normally defined as the tso or half lifetime the time in which the luminance decreases to 509 from the initial value during operation at constant current.

According to spin statistics; the ratio of singlet to triplet excitons in OLEDs is 1:3. However; differing ratios have on the order of several ms [10, 11], high triplet densities are reached in fluorescent devices . The influence of these non-radiatively decaying excitons on the lifetime [12] Or of fluorescent OLEDs has been investigated in only few publications. et al.

The PLEDs consist of an ITO anode; a PEDOT:PSS hole injection layer (40nm) an OC;Cg-PPV Ca cathode (20nm) protected by an Al layer (100nm) layer

In this contribution; the effect of triplet excitons on the degradation of OLEDs is studied in a PLED in which the polymer is blended with a triplet sensitizer. The presence of the sensitizer leads to the enhancement of the triplet concentration in the matrix semiconductor. The impact of the As a result, an accelerated degradation due to the increased triplet-to-singlet ratio be reported. will
