Although there is strong evidence from animal models that mater nal nutritional status pregnancy can induce   permanent changes in the fetus; it is still not clear how this might apply to human populations. Our study adds to the literature on the effects of famine exposure in developing countries. In the present ecological we have found that exposure to the Chinese famine fetal life and infancy was associated with a marginally higher risk during during study ,
