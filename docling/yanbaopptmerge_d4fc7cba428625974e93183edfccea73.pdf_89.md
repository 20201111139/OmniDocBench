The sample standard deviation s is equal to the square root of the sample variance:

## Explanation of the standard deviation calculation shown in the table

The deviations show how spread out the data are about the mean. The data value 11.5 is farther from the mean than is the data value 11 which is indicated by the deviations 0.97 and 0.47.A positive deviation occurs when the data value is greater than the mean, whereas a negative deviation occurs when the data value is less than the mean. The deviation is -1.525 for numbers, and the sum also be positive. The variance; then; is the average squared deviation: By squaring the deviations we are placing an extreme penalty on observations that are far from the mean; these observations get greater weight in the calculations of the variance We will see later on that the variance (standard deviation) plays the critical role in determining We can begin now by using the standard deviation as a measure of unusualness 'How did you do on the test?" "Terrific! Two standard deviations above the mean. This, we will see, is an unusually exam will good

The variance is a squared measure and does not have the same units as the data. Taking the square root solves the problem. The standard deviation measures the spread in the same units as the data.

the sample variance; we divide by the sample size minus one (n 1). Why not divide by n? The answer has to do with the population variance The sample variance is an estimate of the population variance. This estimate requires us to use an estimate of the population mean rather than the actual population mean Based on the theoretical mathematics that lies

OI 0, is either zero larger than zero. Describing the data with reference to the spread is called "variability" . The variability in data depends upon the method by which the outcomes are obtained; for example, by equal to each other. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean; and is larger when When the standard deviation is a lot larger than zero, the data values large.
