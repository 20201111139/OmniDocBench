## SKELETAL MUSCLE PAIRS

To move bones in opposite directions, skeletal muscles often consist of muscle that work in opposition to one another. For example; when the biceps muscle (on the front of the upper arm) contracts, it can cause the elbow joint to flex or bend the arm; as shown in Figure contracts, it can cause the elbow to extend or straighten the arm. The pairs

in the  upper arm are opposing muscles that move the arm at the elbow in opposite directions

## SKELETAL MUSCLE STRUCTURE

Each skeletal muscle consists of hundreds Or even thousands skeletal muscle fibers are individually wrapped in connective tissue called endomysium. The skeletal muscle fibers are bundled together in sheaths of connective tissue called   perimysium. Each fascicle contains between ten and 100 (or even more' ) skeletal muscle fibers\_ The connective tissues in skeletal muscles have a variety of functions. support and protect muscle fibers; allowing them to withstand contraction by distributing the forces applied to the muscle also provide pathways for nerves and blood vessels to reach to tendons They forces They

bundles . Bundles of muscle fibers make up muscle fascicle, and fascicles' bundles make up skeletal muscle. At each  level of bundling, a connective tissue membrane surrounds the bundle. The the whole muscle are surrounded by Endomysium; perimysium; and epimysium, respectively. All connective tissues merge together to make a tendon that attaches the muscle to bones.
