Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate cancer risk and possible risk factors in patients diagnosed with empyema.

A total of 31,636 patients with newly diagnosed empyema between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2010 were included in this study cancer   incidence in these empyema   patients to that in the general whether characteristics increased cancer risk .

patients SIR of 2.67 (95% confidence We excluded cancer that occurred within 1 to avoid surveillance bias. The cancer risk remained significantly increased (SIR empyema had higher SIR of cancers of the head and neck (1.50, 95% CI 1.41-1.58), esophagus (2.56, 95% CI 1.92-3.33), stomach (1.49, 95% CI 1.16 1.89), liver and biliary tract (2.18, 95% CI 1.93-2.45), and and mediastinum (1.62, 95% CI 1.39-1.86).

## INTRODUCTION

mpyema is the accumulation of pus in the thoracic cage that nic fluid. Persistent infection eventually results in the formation of scar tissue and a pleural Even with the advance of antibiotics and pneumococcal vaccines, this still accounts for approximately 5% of cases of pneumonia Incidence of empyema has been increasing worldwide in recent patients require interventional drainage of the pleural space Most studies focus on short-term empyema   complications; however; the long-term effects ofthis disease; including cancer, have hardly been studied:. peel

Dataset (NHIRD) of Taiwan, we conducted a nationwide examine the relative risk of   malignancies; including specific cancer types, in patients with empyema\_ Using
