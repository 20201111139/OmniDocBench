All solutions contained HEPES at 5 mM (extracellular solutions) or 10 mM (intracellular solutions) and were adjusted to pH 7.4. Cl was the major anion in all solutions except those containing methane sulfonate (CH;SO4 where CI 'Kin also contained 0.3 mM GTP and 14 mM phosphocreatine. Concentrations given are in millimolars

epithelium labeled with an anti-OMP antibody. Labeling is seen location of supporting cells. The spotty labeling is similar to what has been shown previously (Graziadei et al., 1980). Labeling is also present at the lumen of the epithelium and likely corresponds to the labeling of dendritic processes of VNO sensory neurons

cells are shown in Figure 2, C and D, as visualized with differential interference contrast microscopy. Cells used for electrophysiology a clearly identifiable dendrite bearing microvilli. Mouse olfactory neurons were also dissociated comparative experiments;, and a typical cell is shown in Figure 2E at the same magnification. Note that VNO neurons are several times larger than olfactory neurons. for

and the epithelium was dissected free. At this anterior position in the nasal cavity; the OE is dorsal to the VNO and lies outside the bony encasing (Fig. 1), and thus contamination of VNO neurons by olfactory neurons is expected. For most experiments; dissociated cells were prepared by incubating the epithelium in divalent-free solution containing trypsin and collagenase then triturating gently. Dissociation either of the two enzymes alone, or no enzyme, did not produce as whether the enzymatic treatment altered the properties of the ion experiments were done without the use of enzymes; these experiments are explicitly stated as such. A population of cells were identified as sensory neurons by morphological criteria. These cells had an ovoid cell body with a mean diameter along the shorter axis of 11.1 + 1.4 (mean + SD; n = dendritic process that varied in length and could be Some short dendrites were probably the result of retraction during the   dissociation   process.

properties of VNO neurons were examined by 58.3 = 2.7 mV (mean = SEM unless other wise noted; range ~43 to ~70 mV; n solutions),   which was significantly more depolarized   than the conditions (~81.8 + 21 mV; n = 6). The input resistance of 3.3 = 7) was similar to that for olfactory neurons (2.9 + = = 39) was several times larger than that of olfactory neurons (1.8 + 0.2 pF; n 7). The responses of a VNO neuron to current injections of current injections gave a membrane time constant of 15.3 + 2.2 msec (n = 7). VNO neurons showed a remarkable sensitivity to small current injections; repetitive action potentials with injections of 1-2 pA. This sensitivity was also observed in cellattached patch-clamp recordings; in which we were routinely able to depolarization of the resting izing firing patch.
