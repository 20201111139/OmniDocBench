AED, antiepileptic drug; MES, maximal electroshock; TD50, the dose eliciting evidence of minimal neurotoxicity in 50% of animals; Cl, confidence interval; ED50, the dose of drug

Pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure test
Rank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal
administration of AEDs in the pentylenetetrazol-induced
clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide
>> valproate = ethosuximide >> phenytoin (Table 1).
Phenytoin was ineffective up to a dose of 300 mg/kg. In
slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant
potency in this test with oral administration in mice was
phenobarbital > rufinamide > ethosuximide >> valproate
>>> phenytoin (Table 2).
Oral rufinamide (≥1,000 mg/kg) and phenytoin (800
mg/kg) did not inhibit pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures
in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticon-
vulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.

Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced
seizure tests in mice
Intraperitoneal rufinamide was effective at nontoxic
doses in the bicuculline and picrotoxin clonic seizure
tests (ED50 ~50-75 mg/kg) and showed partial protec-
tion from strychnine-induced tonic seizures (37.5% pro-
tection; Table 1). Overall, the general order of potency
in these chemically induced seizure tests was phenobarbi-
tal > rufinamide >> valproate = ethosuximide > pheny-
toin (Table 1). In the strychnine-induced tonic seizure test,
phenytoin had the lowest ED50 value, suggesting the great-
est potency. However, it is important to note that 50% pro-
tection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Pheny-
toin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and
picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice.

Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice
The median toxic dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide
(TD50) in the rotorod test of behavioral impairment was
500-1,000 mg/kg. The TD50 for rufinamide was higher
than that for comparator AEDs (Table 1), indicating a
lower toxicity. Higher doses of rufinamide were not as-
sessed due the low ED50 values and high protective index
(>40).
Neurological side effects of very high-dose intraperi-
toneal rufinamide (1,000 mg/kg, n = 2; ED50 15-100
mg/kg) included decreased motor activity, ataxia, muscle
relaxation, decreased respiration, and death (one animal
died; the other appeared normal). Higher doses of the com-
parator drugs induced increased side effects (2 × TD50)
and resulted in death (all animals) in 3-24 h (4 × TD50).
The safety ratio for rufinamide in mice (TD3/ED97 >19.2
[intraperitoneal] and >23.8 [oral]) was consistently greater
than for phenytoin, phenobarbital, and valproate (Table 4).
The median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required
to produce loss of righting reflex in mice (HD50) was
>500 and <1,000 mg/kg (Table 5). Rufinamide had a nu-
merically greater HD50 value than phenytoin or phenobar-
bital (HD50 values of 178 and 135 mg/kg, respectively).
Rufinamide, ethosuximide, and valproate had comparable
