What can we do to solve these problems?

If we eat more vegetables and less meat, we will easily get more food. Land that is used to grow crops
can feed five times more people than land where animals are kept.
The world population will not rise so quickly if people use modern methods of birth control.
Finally, if we educate people to think about the problems, we shall have a better and cleaner living place
in the future.
