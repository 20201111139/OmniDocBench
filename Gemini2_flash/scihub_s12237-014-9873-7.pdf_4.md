The different experimental CO\(_2\) levels in the mesocosms and in rearing containers were achieved and maintained during the entire experimental period by active injection of mixed CO\(_2\) and air. The
experimental nominal treatments considered three different CO\(_2\) levels: 400 ppm (present), 700 (year 2100*), and 1,000 (year 2200*). pH values are presented with three decimals according with the Guide
to best practices for ocean acidification research and data reporting
