SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) requires that, within 12 months after the listing of an endangered or threatened species, the Federal Register be revised to list any new species that may be warranted, we make a finding (“12-month finding”). In this finding, we determine whether the Huaçuca-Canelo population of the Arkansas darter, black mudalia, Highlands tiger beetle, Dichanthelium (=panicum) hirstii (Hirst Brothers’ panic grass), Kentucky cave beetles (Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle), relict leopard frog, sickelín redhorse sucker, and Stephan’s rifflé beetle is: (1) Not warranted; (2) warranted; or (3) warranted, but the immediate proposal of a regulation implementing the listing is precluded by other pending proposals to determine whether species are endangered or threatened species, and expeditious progress is being made to add or remove qualified species from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants (“warranted but precluded”). Section 4(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that we treat a petition for which the requested action is found to be warranted but precluded as though resubmitted on the date of such finding, that is, requiring a subsequent finding to be made within 12 months. We must publish these 12-month findings in the Federal Register.

Summary of Information Pertaining to the Five Factors

Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and the implementing regulations in part 424 of title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR part 424) set forth procedures for adding species to, removing species from, or reclassifying species on the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. The Act defines “endangered species” as any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range (16 U.S.C. 1532(6)), and “threatened species” as any species that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range (16 U.S.C. 1532(20)). Under section 4(a)(1) of the Act, a species may be determined to be an endangered or a threatened species because of any of the following five factors:

(A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;
(B) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;
(C) Disease or predation;
(D) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or
(E) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

We summarize below the information on which we based our evaluation of the five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of the Act to determine whether the Huaçuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog, the Arkansas darter, black mudalia, Highlands tiger beetle, Dichanthelium (=panicum) hirstii, two Kentucky cave beetles (Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle), relict leopard frog, sickelín redhorse sucker, and Stephan’s rifflé beetle may be a threat. In that case, we determine if that stressor is the level of threat, the combination may drive or contribute to the risk of extinction of the species—such stressor is the level of threat, the combination may drive or contribute to the risk of extinction of the species—such stressor is the level of threat, the combination may drive or contribute to the risk of extinction of the species—such stressor is the level of threat, the combination may drive or contribute to the risk of extinction of the species—such stressor is the level of threat, the combination may drive or contribute to the risk of extinction of the species. The more identification of stressors that could affect a species negatively is not sufficient to compel a finding that
