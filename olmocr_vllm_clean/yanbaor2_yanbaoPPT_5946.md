Still moving away from the middle
Consumers continue to either trade up or trade down, moving away from midmarket brands. Although globally the trade-up trend is slightly stronger than the trade-down trend, the survey results show vast differences at the country level. Last year, when we saw a marked increase in trade-up behavior among Indian consumers, we predicted a continuation of that trend—driven largely by rapid urbanization, the expansion of modern retail outlets, and premiumization in several CPG categories including beauty products, beverages, and packaged food. Indeed, the latest survey shows that India had the highest trade-up rate, at 25 percent (Exhibit 2).

Turkey and China, too, had trade-up rates of 20 percent or higher. Turkish consumers have been active up-traders over the past two years. In the 2016 the latest figure is, unsurprisingly, down slightly, due to tougher economic conditions in Turkey. In China, gains in consumer confidence have led to increases in discretionary spending. A mere 2 percent of Chinese consumers said they traded down.

What it means to be thrifty
In some Latin American and African countries, on the other hand, trade-down rates were upward of 20 percent, whereas trade-up rates were in the single digits. Consumer companies should note that in these developing economies, down-traders often opted for lower-priced branded products rather than retailers’ private-label products. Take nonalcoholic beverages, for instance: only 19 percent of down-traders in Latin America said they switched to private-label products in this category, whereas in North America, 73 percent of down-traders did so. We observed the same pattern in a number of other CPG categories, including food and household products. CPG manufacturers should therefore consider launching—and aggressively marketing—branded products in entry-level price tiers in these countries.
