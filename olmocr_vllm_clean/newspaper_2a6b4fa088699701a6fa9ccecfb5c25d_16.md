Resources Commission, Duke Energy Carolina, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Friends of the Apalachicola and Georgia Department of Natural Resources. A primary goal of the CCA is to expand the range of this species upstream of barriers, and into all suitable, potentially contiguous stream reaches that were formerly degraded, but currently appear suitable. Excluding the sicklefin redhorse sucker into the upper sections of these watersheds will provide a greater variety of available habitat, allowing the species to more easily adjust to temporary effects of construction and landscape alteration, and provide more opportunities to use areas of refuge during periods of adverse conditions, such as periods of high temperature. Accessibility to more suitable habitat will increase the number of available spawning sites, increasing the opportunities for successful recruitment, and will provide alternative spawning areas should some spawning sites become unsuitable. Successful reintroduction will increase the carrying capacity of the sicklefin redhorse sucker, by providing the species with additional riverine habitat as well as access to additional reservoirs to support a more viable rearing habitat. The SSA Report for the sicklefin redhorse sucker noted that threats (i.e., factors affecting the species) could be exacerbated by changes in temperature or interactions between the species. However, the SSA Report’s evaluation of all of the threats facing this species indicates that the existing populations are stable and are likely to remain stable in most of the plausible future scenarios. In addition, while populations are currently stable and likely to remain so, under the CCA’s management framework, the parties will work cooperatively to address threats in a way that reduces the likelihood that they will negatively affect the future viability of the species.

Finding

Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act’s five threat factors, we find that the factors acting on the species and its habitat, either singly or in combination, are not of such magnitude or intensity to indicate that the sicklefin redhorse sucker is in danger of extinction (an endangered species), or likely to become so in the foreseeable future (a threatened species), throughout all of its range. This finding is based on stability of existing populations, re-evaluation of threats that are likely to affect the populations in the future, and development of a CCA that ensures the continued participation by all stakeholders in a focused effort to address and mitigate any potential threats while expanding the range and population health of the species. Additionally, we evaluated the current range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker to determine if there is any apparent geographic concentration of potential threats to the species. The current range of the species is relatively small and limited to two river systems in western North Carolina and northwestern Georgia. We examined potential threats from: (1) Hydroelectric operations, inadequate erosion/ sedimentation control during agricultural, timbering, and construction activities; (2) runoff and discharge of organic and inorganic pollutants from industrial, municipal, agricultural, and other point and nonpoint sources; (3) habitat alterations associated with channelization and in-stream dredging/ mining activities; (4) predation and habitat suitability impacts by nonnative species; (5) fragmentation and isolation of surviving populations; and (6) other natural and human-related factors that adversely modify the aquatic environment. We found no threats of the species’ range where potential threats are significantly concentrated or substantially greater than in other portions of its range so as to suggest that the species may be in danger of extinction in a portion of its range. Therefore, we find that factors affecting the sicklefin redhorse sucker are essentially uniform throughout its range, indicating no portion of the range warrants further consideration of possible endangered or threatened status under the Act. Therefore, we find that listing the sicklefin redhorse sucker as an endangered or a threatened species under the Act is not warranted throughout all or a significant portion of its range at this time, and consequently we are removing it from candidate status.

As a result of the Service’s 2011 multistate litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register. September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation, No. 10-377 (E.D.Cal., D.D.C. May 10, 2011)), for all 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service’s November 10, 2010, CNOR. This document satisfies the requirements of that settlement agreement for the sicklefin redhorse sucker, and constitutes the Service’s 12-month finding on the April 20, 2010, petition to list the sicklefin redhorse sucker as an endangered or threatened species. A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding, including the PECE policy analysis, is found in the sicklefin redhorse sucker’s species-specific assessment form, SSA Report, and other associated documents (see ADDRESSES, above).

Stephan’s Rifle Bee (Heterelmis stephani)

Previous Federal Actions

Stephan’s rifle bee (Heterelmis stephani) was designated as a Category 2 candidate in the拧手发表 in the Federal Register on May 22, 1984, at 49 FR 21664, Category 2 candidate status was reevaluated for taxa for which the Service possessed information indicating proposing to list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was lacking. The February 28, 1996, CNOR (61 FR 7596) discontinued recognition of categories, so this species was no longer considered a candidate species. In the June 13, 2002, CNOR (67 FR 40657), Stephan’s rifle bee was designated as a candidate species as currently defined, with proposed listing in May 2002. On May 11, 2004, we received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity, contending that 225 plants and animals, including Stephan’s rifle bee, be listed as endangered species under the Act and critical habitat be designated. On May 24, 2004, petition to list Stephan’s rifle bee as an endangered species, we published a notice in the Federal Register, May 21, 2004, of our proposed listing status under the Act. In May 2004, petition to list Stephan’s rifle bee as an endangered species, we published a notice of intent to publish a 12-month finding on the Stephan's rifle bee in the Federal Register. May 11, 2005 (70 FR 25376), proposing to list the species. The 12-month finding was published on September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53736), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 19, 2011 (76 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 19, 2010 (75 FR 66220), December 1, 2011 (76 FR 73370), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 50854).

Background

Stephan’s rifle bee is one of five known species in the genus Heterelmis found in the United States. Historically, Stephan's rifle bee occurred in Santa Cruz and Pima Counties, Arizona, at two known locations: Bog Springs Campground and Sylvester Spring in
