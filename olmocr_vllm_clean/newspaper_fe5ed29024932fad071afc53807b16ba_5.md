stability positively impacts small and large producers by allowing them to better anticipate the sales season and prepare their raisins will generate.

There are some reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements under the Act. The reporting and recordkeeping burdens are necessary for compliance purposes and for developing statistical data for maintenance of the program. The requirements are the same as those applied in past seasons. Thus, this action imposes no additional reporting or recordkeeping burdens on either small or large handlers. The forms require information which is readily available from handler records and which can be provided without data processing equipment or trained or statistical staff. The information collection and recordkeeping requirements have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB Control No. 0581–0178. As with other similar marketing order programs, reports and forms are periodically studied to reduce or eliminate duplicate information collection and burdens on industry and public sector agencies. In addition, USDA has not identified any relevant Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this rule.

Further, Committee and subcommittee meetings are widely publicized in advance and are held in a location central to the production area. The meetings are open to all industry members, including small business entities, and other interested persons who are encouraged to participate in the deliberations and voice their opinions on topics under discussion. An interim final rule concerning this action was published in the Federal Register on April 22, 2004 (69 FR 21695). Copies of the rule were mailed to all Committee members and administered to the Raisin Marketing Agreement, handlers, and dehydrators. In addition, the rule was made available through the Internet by the Office of the Federal Register and USDA. That rule provided for a 60-day comment period that ended on June 21, 2004. No comments were received.

A small business guide on complying with fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop marketing orders and regulations can be obtained by the California Raisin Advisory Board at its web site at: http://www.ans.usda.gov/ fnwahub.html. Any questions about the committee guide should be sent to or Gueber at the previously mentioned address in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

[Docket No. 04–20]

RIN 1557–AC11

Fundamental Change in Asset Composition of a Bank

AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is amending its regulations to require a national bank to obtain the approval of the OCC before changing the composition of all, or substantially all, of its assets (1) through other than normal business operations, or (2) after having sold or disposed of all, or substantially all, of its assets, through subsequent purchases or other acquisitions or other expansions of its operations. The final rule provides that, in the second case, the OCC will apply, among other factors, the same factors as it applies to the establishment of a de novo bank. This new approval requirement will enable the OCC to better assess the bank’s compliance with applicable law and whether the proposed change comports with safe and sound banking practices.

DATES: Effective Date: October 1, 2004.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For questions concerning the final rule, contact Heidi M. Thomas, Special Counsel, Legislative and Regulatory Activities, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 550 12th Street, SW., Richard Cleva, Senior Counsel, Bank Activities and Structure Division, at (202) 874–5300, or Jan Kaimus, NIE/Licensing Expert, Licensing Activities Division, at (202) 874–5060, 250 E. Street, SW., Washington, DC 20219.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

1. Introduction.

The OCC’s current regulations at 12 CFR part 5 do not require the approval of the OCC before a national bank substantially changes the composition of its assets through either normal business disposition, nor do they require prior OCC review or approval before a national bank charters a new “stripped” or “dormant” bank charter. Likewise, our regulations do not address a dormant national bank’s increase in asset size through purchases or acquisitions to engage again in the business of banking. On January 7, 2004, we proposed to add to our regulations a prior approval requirement for these fundamental changes in a bank’s asset composition in order to address, among other things, supervisory concerns raised by these types of transactions. See 69 FR 892 (Jan. 7, 2004).

As described in the preamble to the proposed rule, these concerns may include increased operational risk, increased concentration risk (especially where asset composition changes as a result of divestiture), and the ability of bank management to implement the new strategy successfully. In addition, a dormant bank being revived may propose to engage in activities that significantly deviate or are a change from the bank’s original business plan or operations. If ill-conceived, poorly planned, or inadequately executed, these new activities can expose the bank to imprudent levels of risk, with the potential for adverse effects on the bank’s financial condition and, in the extreme situation, for its viability. Even entry into lines of business that are traditional for national banks may present elevated levels of risk to a particular bank if the bank’s business model substantially or too quickly from a dormant status, misjudges its markets, or fails to ensure that bank management and internal controls are in place with the change. The preamble to the proposal also noted that concerns raised by the acquisition of de novo banks by a third party necessitates the need for the OCC to thoroughly review the nature of the services and products that might be initiated by an acquired entity.

For the reasons discussed in this preamble, we are adopting in final form
