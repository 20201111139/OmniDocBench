including the sicklefin redhorse sucker. The petition included supporting information regarding the species' taxonomy and ecology, historical and current distribution, present status, and actual and potential causes of decline. In a partial basis decision, the Service requested that the petition be listed as a petition to list 404 species, published on September 27, 2011 (76 FR 59836), the Service requested information about the candidate status of the sicklefin redhorse sucker.

**Background**

The sicklefin redhorse sucker (Moxostomum microstomum), a freshwater fish species, can grow to a length of approximately 650 mm (roughly 25.6 in). The species has a compressed body and a high falcate (sickle shaped) dorsal fin (back fin). Its body is olive-colored, with a coppery or brassy sheen; its lower fins (pectoral, pelvic, and anal fins) are primarily dusky to dark, often tinted yellow or orange and pale edged; the caudal fin (tail fin) is mostly red; and its dorsal fin is olive in color, sometimes partly red. Although the sicklefin redhorse sucker is now known to have been collected in 1937 (based upon preserved specimens collected at the then-unnamed mouth of Fornet Creek near its confluence with the Tuckasegee River), it was not recognized as a population distinct from other sicklefin redhorse sucker characteristics of the specimens’ lower lips, dorsal fins, and pharyngeal teeth, Jenkins recognized the species as a previously unidentified species or a hybrid of the smallmouth redhorse (M. lamyi) and the large redhorse (M. carinatum). Subsequent detailed morphological and behavioral studies and genetic studies have concluded that the species is distinct in fact, a distinct species. The Service has reviewed the available taxonomic literature and field data, and these studies challenge the validity of this conclusion.

**Summary of Status Review**

In completing our status review, we reviewed the best available scientific and commercial information and have compiled this information in the SESA Report for the sicklefin redhorse sucker. For our finding, we evaluated potential stressors related to the sicklefin redhorse sucker and its habitat. The stressors we analyzed were: (1) Hydroelectric operations, inadequate erosion/sedimentation control during agricultural, timbering, and construction activities; (2) runoffs of nutrients, sewage, and organic and inorganic pollutants from industrial, municipal, agricultural, and other point and nonpoint sources; (3) habitat alteration associated with channelization and instream dredging/ mining activities; (4) predation and population stability impacts by nonnative species; (5) fragmentation and isolation of surviving populations; and (6) other natural and human-related factors that adversely modify the aquatic environment.

**Factors of Concern**

**Factors of concern**

A number of factors likely contributed to the sicklefin redhorse sucker’s historical range and may have affected population dynamics within the existing occupied stream reaches. The construction of hydroelectric facilities and damming of portions of the species is thought to occur in the juvenile stage of its life cycle. The sicklefin redhorse sucker also appears to be absent or limited to several reaches of unimpounded river habitat where it was likely extirpated by degradation of the habitat caused by excessive runoff; periods of hypolimnetic (deepwater that remains permanently cold) or high-potential (elevated) discharge of water for hydropower production. The introduction of blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis) into the habitat occupied by the sicklefin redhorse sucker was also considered a potential threat to future population stability in post-candidate assessments.
