\[ Docket No. FV04–989–1 FIR \]

**Raisins Produced From Grapes Grown in California; Final Free and Reserve Percentages for 2003–04 Crop Natural (Sun-Dried) Seedless Raisins**

**AGENCY:** Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA.  
**ACTION:** Final rule.

**SUMMARY:** The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is adopting, as a final rule, without change, an interim final rule that established final volume regulation percentages for 2003–04 crop Natural (sun-dried) Seedless (NS) raisins covered under the Federal marketing order for California raisins (order). The order regulates the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California and is locally administered by the Raisin Administrative Committee (RAC or Committee) under USDA oversight. The percentages are 70 percent free and 30 percent reserve. The percentages represent the quantity of raisins from the 2003–04 crop which may be sold freely in domestic and export markets (free tonnage), and the portion that must be held at reserve and not sold in those markets (reserve tonnage).

**EFFECTIVE DATE:** Effective September 15, 2004. The volume regulation percentages apply to acquisitions of NS raisins from the 2003–04 crop and the reserve raisins constructed from that crop disposed of under the order.

**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:** This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 (7 CFR part 989), both as amended, regulating the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California. "Raisins" refers to raisins "naturally" or sun-dried, as defined under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601–674), hereinafter referred to as the "Act."

USDA is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. Under the order provisions now in effect, final free and reserve percentages have been established for the crop year. This rule continues to prescribe final free and reserve percentages for the 2003–04 crop year, which began August 1, 2003, and ends July 31, 2004. This is the final rule of this process.

This rule continues in effect final volume regulation percentages for 2003–04 crop NS raisins acquired by handlers. The volume regulation percentages are 70 percent free and 30 percent reserve. The final percentages are based on revised production estimates for 2003–04, as compiled by the RAC. Free tonnage may be sold by handlers in any market while raisins held in a pool for reserve cannot be sold fresh. There should be minimal or no impact on the market for the 2003–04 NS raisins based upon these new percentages.

Under the order, handlers are encouraged to rotate their inventories so that the free raisins from the reserve pool are sold first. The significant increase in free tonnage from the interim percentages was necessitated due to upward trend acreage and yields observed through the RAC's deliberations in various production areas within the state.

The final free and reserve percentages will apply to acquisitions of NS raisins from this crop, made directly with growers under independent agreements, or that contain non-freeze conditions. As before, all handlers who acquire or contract to acquire free tonnage must report data on raisin acquisitions weekly to the RAC, and disposition of tonnage must be reported monthly.

USDA has determined that this action will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment and decisions made on this action will not significantly impact the current production percentage evaluation processes.
