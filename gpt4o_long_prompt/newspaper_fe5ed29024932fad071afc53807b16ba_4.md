There are essentially two broad markets for raisins—domestic and export. In recent years, both export and domestic shipments have been decreasing. Domestic shipments decreased from a high of 204,805 packed tons during the 1990–91 crop year to a low of 156,325 packed tons in 1999–2000. In addition, exports decreased from 114,576 packed tons in 1991–92 to a low of 96,000 packed tons in the 1999–2000 crop year.

In addition, the per capita consumption of raisins has declined from 2.07 pounds in 1988 to 1.48 pounds in 2002. This decrease is consistent with the decrease in the per capita consumption of dried fruits in general, which is due to the increasing availability of most types of fresh fruit throughout the year.

While the overall demand for raisins has been decreasing (as reflected in the decline in commercial shipments), production has been increasing. Deliveries of NS (dried) raisins from producers to handlers reached an all-time high of 432,618 tons in the 2000–01 crop year. This larger crop was followed by two crop years of underdeliveries: 2001–02 and 2002–03 (372,376 tons in 2001–02 and 299,819 tons in 1999–2000). Deliveries to free and reserve pool handlers have fluctuated each year because of increased bearing acreage and yields. Deliveries for the 2001–02 crop year were 372,376 tons, and deliveries for the 2002–03 crop year were 388,016 tons. Deliveries through the week ending June 19, 2004, of the current crop year were 249,826 tons. Three crop years of high production and a large 2001–02 carry in reserves have contributed to the industry's burdensome supply of raisins.

The order permits the industry to exercise supply control provisions, which allow for the establishment of free and reserve percentages, and establishment of a reserve pool. One of the primary purposes of establishing free and reserve percentages is to equitably supply and demand. If raisin markets are oversupplied with product, producer prices will decline.

Raisins are generally marketed at relatively lower price levels in the more elastic export market than in the more inelastic domestic market. This results in a larger volume of raisins being marketed and enhances producer returns. In addition, this system allows the U.S. raisin industry to be more competitive in these export markets.

To assess the impact that volume control has on prices, producers receive for their product the econometric model has been constructed. The model developed for the purpose of estimating minimum prices under a number of scenarios using the volume control authority under the Federal marketing order. The price producers receive for the harvest and delivery of their crops is largely determined by the level of production and the volume of carry-in inventories. The Federal marketing order permits the industry to exercise supply control provisions, which allow for the establishment of reserve and free pools, and the establishment of a reserve pool. The establishment of reserve percentages impacts the primary markets.

The reserve percentage limits what handlers can market at free tonnage. Assuming the 10 percent reserve limits the total free tonnage to 387,638 natural condition tons (TNC) (296,525 tons delivered through June 19, 2004) and carryin is 129,345 natural condition tons, and the total known reserve total 66,470 natural condition tons (which includes reserve raisins released through both 10 plus 10 offers plus the offer under § 989.67(n), then the total free supply is estimated at 403,723 natural condition tons. The econometric model estimates the price to be $863 per ton higher than under an unregulated scenario. This price increase is beneficial to all producers regardless of size and enhances producers' total revenues in comparison to no volume control. Establishing a reserve allows the industry to stabilize supplies in both domestic and export markets, while improving returns to producers.

Free and reserve percentages are established by varietal type, and usually in years when the supply exceeds the trade demand by a wide enough margin that the Committee believes volume regulation is necessary to maintain market stability. Accordingly, the regulation whether to apply volume regulation or, as an alternative, not apply such regulation, is assessed each year. This evaluation regulation is warranted this season for only one of the nine raisin varietal types defined under the order.

The free and reserve percentages established by this rule release to full trade demand the supply uniformly to all handlers in the industry, regardless of size. For the 1988–99 crop year, small and large raisin producers and handlers have been operating under volume regulation approximately each year since 1983–84. There are no known additional costs incurred by smaller handlers that are not incurred by large handlers. While the level of benefits of stabilization are difficult to quantify, the stabilizing effects of volume regulation assist small and large handlers positively by helping them match supply and market demands without exposing handlers with season to season issues. Likewise, price...
