Frogs at Lower Blue Point Spring warrants further evaluation of its impact to the species. Although repeated evidence has been documented in one population, there is no indication any frogs have been adversely affected by disease. The Conservation Team will continue to monitor populations for effects of disease. Any potential effects at the individual or site-specific level resulting from nonnative fish in the Northshore Springs Complex and Corn Creek are low in severity. Disease and predation are not having a population-level effect on the relict leopard frog now, and such effects are not expected to occur in the future. The Conservation Team is taking action to improve the conditions for disease and predation through conservation measures (see ‘‘Conservation Actions Implemented,” above).

The small population size is the most severe and immediate problem of conservation efforts, including population augmentation and establishing introduction sites. Low numbers of individual frogs at a given site may increase risk and vulnerability of the species to any adverse stressors. Although small population size can affect the species as a whole by reducing genetic diversity and possibly reducing the species’ ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, the best available scientific and commercial information shows that this species is capable of expanding into unforeseeable future with current population sizes and under existing levels of management by the Conservation Team. The potential for effects of small population size has been, and will continue to be, minimized by actions taken by the Conservation Team, including habitat management and a captive-rearing program that introduces frogs from eggs collected in the wild. These frogs are used to establish new sites and augment both natural and introduction sites, as appropriate. Conservation Team actions continue to minimize potential for effects of small population size, and small population effects are not expected to alter the proportion of individuals affected in the future.

Climate change effects may result in increased spring flow, habitat loss, inundation of overwintering areas, and increased early season flooding that could adversely affect relict leopard frog populations. Although negative environmental change could occur to individuals or specific sites, species-level effects would not be expected now or into the foreseeable future to the extent that rangewide numbers and distribution would be largerly reduced. The relict leopard frog Conservation Team has been addressing these stressors in the past, and ongoing efforts are planned to continue into the future.

We considered relevant Federal, State, and tribal laws and regulations when evaluating the status of the species. Regulatory mechanisms, if they exist, may preclude the need for listing if we determine that such mechanisms adequately reduce the stressors to the species such that listing is not warranted. The effects of applicable existing regulatory mechanisms are considered in our evaluation of the stressors acting on the species. Below, we briefly review those regulatory mechanisms aimed to help reduce stressors to the relict leopard frog and its habitat.

The relict leopard frog is protected by the State laws of Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 503.357 state that before a person may obtain a right to the use of water from a spring or water that has seeped to the surface of the ground, that person must ensure that wildlife with customary access to the water will have access to it. However, the State Engineer, who oversees water law rights, may waive this requirement for a domestic use of water (NRS 533.367). Authority provided by NRS 503.537 allows the Wildlife Commission to use its authority to manage land to carry out a program for conserving, protecting, restoring and propagating selected species of native fish, wildlife, and other vertebrates and their habitat, with the threat detected by extinction and destruction. Also, habitat protection for the relict leopard frog is provided by Nevada Revised Statute Code 504.520, which allows permits for the sale of wildlife or streams to be maintained in a wild or stream environment by private ownership without a permit. The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) classified the relict leopard frog as a Tier 1a Species of Greatest Conservation. Commission Order 41 of the AGFD regulations prohibits collection or hunting of relict leopard frogs, except under the authority of a special permit. Protection under Commission Order 41 provides protection to individuals but does not prohibit take.

The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources classified the relict leopard frog as a Sensitive Species in Utah. State of Utah Rule 657–30 prohibits the collection, importation, and possession of relict leopard frogs without a certificate of registration that provides protection for habitat.

All populations of the relict leopard frog occur on Federal land (Service, BLM, NPS). Existing Federal laws, such as the Endangered Act of 1976, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), National Environmental Policy Act of 1976 (NEPA; 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), and the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 (Pub. L. 105–57), have facilitated conservation efforts that have reduced the threats to this relict leopard frog. Efforts to manage all current relict leopard frog sites except Pupfish Refuge and Corn Creek. The Pupfish Refuge comprises a portion of land at Hoover Dam and Corn Creek, and is an experimental population on a Service National Wildlife Refuge. NPS provides the captive-rearing facility, which is integral for establishing and augmenting relict leopard frog populations.

BLM uses their regulatory mechanisms and authority to provide sites to establish new populations of relict leopard frog. BLM sensitive species policy instruction specifies protection to improvements to benefit the species.

BLM’s manual (6840)—Special Status Species Management Responsibilities policy statesthe presence of BLM sensitive species under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). BLM sensitive species will be best managed consistent with species and habitat management objectives in a coordinated approach between BLM management and the Service to allow land management plans to •ensure the likelyhood and cost of implementing the Conservation Team and members at statutory obligation to time intervals or continuous restoration at the refugee edges.

The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 provides each mission to the Service’s wildlife refuges to administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation,; restoration, and, where appropriate, management of the fish, wildlife, and plant resources and habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Each refuge is required to sustain its mission and provide for the conservation of fish, wildlife and plants, and their habitats within the Refuge System. By then the stage of the initial report, the National Wildlife Refuge System and Federal Government of States and other Federal agencies to conserve and protect its habitat that allows it to assist in the maintenance of adequate water quantity, and water quality, to fulfill its mission and vision of the relict leopard frog and on its habitat.

The Refuge anticipated interest in establishing new policy guidelines that actually be followed in its concept called on the resource to monitor the populous results of frog habitats to minimize standard《formal but comprehensive like the border arrangements》. The Refuge continues to .
