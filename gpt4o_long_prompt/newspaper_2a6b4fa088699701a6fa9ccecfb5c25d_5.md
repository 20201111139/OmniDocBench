A continuation of similar levels of impact from the stressors affecting this species as we have in the past. We believe an annual rate of groundwater usage and continued rates of impact from other stressors over the next 30 years would not likely result in significant effects to the occupied range of the Arkansas darter. Although we expect little change on a rangewide basis, we could see some range contraction in the western Cimarron and upper Rattlesnake Creek basins in Kansas and Oklahoma due to water depletion, as well as small portions of the Colorado range. Additionally, we could see range contraction in the eastern portion of its range (Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma) due to development effects. However, we do not expect to see a reduction in redundancy of the species overall (e.g., no loss to discrete populations).

### Finding

Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act’s five factors, we found that the stressors acting on the species and its habitat, either singly or in combination, are not of sufficient imminence, intensity, or magnitude to indicate that the Arkansas darter is currently in danger of extinction (endangered) in any significant portion of its range, or likely to become endangered (within the foreseeable future at threatened species) in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we conclude that listing throughout its range is not warranted.

### Black Mudalia (Elimia melanoides) 

#### Previous Federal Actions

The Service first identified black mudalia as a candidate for listing on September 12, 2006, and assigned an LPN of 2 based on imminent, high-magnitude threats (71 FR 53618). In the December 7, 2007, CNOR, we concluded that the threats were of the same moderate in magnitude and changed the LPN to 8 (72 FR 69034). We retained the LPN of 8 in all subsequent CNORs (see December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69804), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584)).

On April 20, 2010, we received a petition from The Center for Biological Diversity requesting that the Service list 404 species, including black mudalia, as endangered or threatened. No new information regarding black mudalia was presented in the petition, and on September 27, 2011, we published a 90-day finding (76 FR 59836).

#### Description

The species formerly described as black mudalia is a small species of aquatic snail in the family Pleuroceridae, commonly called mudalia. This species is primarily elongate to the aquatic snail family Pleuroceridae, black mudalia is generally described as the black mudalia was found clinging to clean gravel, cobble, boulders, and logs in flowing water streams of moderate to low gradient in the Locust Fork drainage in Jefferson and Blount Counties, Alabama.

### Summary of Status Review

The following summary is based on a review of the best available scientific and commercial information. 

The new information was provided into the Service reached our finding by 2010. The species was described from "rivers in North Alabama" by T.A. Conrad in 1834. Subsequent collections failed to produce a specific type of the locality. The reference of the Conrad locality, the black mudalia was considered to be extinct. However, in 2003, Dr. Russell Minton published a paper, which was a rediscovery of what he believed was Conrad's black mudalia.

The disgendant is not available from the hypotype Black mudalia from the neotype—a biological specimen that is selected as the type specimen when the original is absent (which is rare for designation of a new species), lost type locality to close into the Little Alabama River in Blount County, Alabama; however, the species is currently unavailable for study.
