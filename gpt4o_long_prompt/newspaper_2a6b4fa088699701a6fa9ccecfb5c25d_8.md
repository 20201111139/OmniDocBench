# Federal Register / Vol. 81, No. 194 / Thursday, October 6, 2016 / Rules and Regulations

the Service possessed information indicating proposing to list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was lacking. \[ \text{Candidate species} \] file in subsequent plant notices of review in 1983, 1985, 1989, and 1993 (48 FR 53640, November 28, 1983; 50 FR 39526, September 27, 1985; 55 FR 6184, February 21, 1990; 58 FR 51144, September 30, 1993). The Service did not publish any other notices of review for plants during this time period.

The Service revised candidate categories in 1996, and *Panicum hirstii* was not included as a candidate species under the updated categorization (61 FR 7596; February 28, 1996). The revised categories further defined a candidate species as a species for which we have on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats to support issuance of a listing proposal, but for which development of a listing regulation is precluded by other higher-priority listing activities.

In 1999, the Service included *Panicum hirstii* as a new candidate species, using the updated definition, through its new internal assessment process (i.e., not via a petition), and assigned it an LPN of 5, meaning it was a species with a high magnitude of imminent threats (64 FR 57534, October 25, 1999). Annual candidate notices of review issued subsequent annual CNORs with an LPN of 5 in 2001, 2002, and 2004 (66 FR 54808, October 30, 2001; 67 FR 40657, June 13, 2002; 69 FR 24876, May 4, 2004). The Service did not publish a CNOR in 2003. 

On May 14, 2004, we received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity and other groups and individuals requesting that the Service list *Panicum hirstii* and 225 other candidate species as endangered species or threatened species under the Act. In 2005, the Service again made the warranted-but-precluded finding for the plant with an LPN of 5, but noted an increase in specific habitat for *Dichanthelium hirstii* (70 FR 24870, May 11, 2005). In closing the 2004, *D. hirstii* remained as a candidate with an LPN of 5 (see September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), and December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450)). In 2015, its LPN was reduced to 2 as a candidate in the CNOR, but the LPN was elevated from 5 to 2, indicating a species with a high magnitude of imminent threats (80 FR 80584, December 24, 2015).

## Background

*Dichanthelium hirstii*, as referenced in some literature, is a perennial, wetland-obligate grass that is currently estimated to occur in eight locations distributed across four States: New Jersey (Barckwoods Pond, Labounsky Pond, and Benni Avenue Bogs North in Atlantic County, and Hampton Furnace Pond in Burlington County); Delaware (Assawoman Pond in Sussex County); North Carolina (Transfer Pond and Lyman Road in Onslow County); and Georgia (Lake Pond in Sumter County). A ninth location, in Calhoun County, Georgia, is considered historical.

## Summary of Status Review

The plant that the Service has been referring to as either *P. hirstii* or *D. hirstii* has always had a complex taxonomic history, and as knowledge over time has added to its understanding as its scientific name and morphology has evolved. The Flora of North America (FNA) is one source for information available to the Service and is considered the normative authority for plants in North America because it combines systematic and taxonomic knowledge of plant names of North America. While several authors have published regional flora and local descriptions that recognize both *Dichanthelium hirstii* as a separate entity, new publications recently reinterviewed found the plant taxonomic treatment was the 2003 FNA, which is a complete taxonomic treatment of the *Dichanthelium hirstii* and the species therein, that explicitly relegates *P. hirstii* to *D. hirstii* as a synonym of *Dichanthelium scoparium* (Ashe). This indicates that the plant the Service had considered a candidate species is not a valid taxon and is composed of a larger, more widespread species that appears to be seen on the coastal plain from Delaware to southeastern Texas from Delaware to Texas. Although the Integrated *Taxonomic Information System (ITS)*, *Dichanthelium hirstii* is shown in its records as a valid accepted species and the Service often relies on ITIS as a reliable database source of taxonomic information, in this instance ITIS is incorrect. Given this closer review of the taxonomic history of *D. hirstii*, the Service recognizes that we overlooked the significance of the synonymy information, and in retrospect should not have included *P. hirstii* or *D. hirstii* as a candidate species. With the 2015 published and draft documents of McEvoy et al. and Weakley, respectively, and the ITIS database information, are more recent than the 2003 FNA’s published treatment, thus new documents and database methodologies processed collectively represent a more comprehensive systematic analysis of the plant’s taxonomic status because they are not full taxonomic treatments in *Panicum and Dichanthelium*. Therefore, the Service considers them the FNA’s 2003 treatment of *Panicum* and *Dichanthelium* as representing the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the plant’s taxonomic status. The FNA's treatment indicates that neither *P. hirstii* nor *D. hirstii* is considered a species, subspecies, or variety. Therefore, the best available scientific and commercial information did not indicate that either *P. hirstii* or *D. hirstii* meets the Act’s definition of ‘‘species’’ and, thus, neither *P. hirstii* nor *D. hirstii* warrant listing under the Act. 

## Findings

Based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we conclude that *Dichanthelium hirstii* does not meet the Act’s definition of ‘‘species’’ and that the best available scientific and commercial information does not indicate *Dichanthelium hirstii* has a separate distinct name offshoot throughout species, from the coastal plain from Delaware to southeastern Texas in and in the West Indies area. Thus, we are removing *Dichanthelium hirstii* from the candidate list.

As a result of the Service’s 2011 commitment to settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (*In re Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation*, No. 10–377 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011). All 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service’s November 2010 CNOR, Thirty others document satisfies the requirements of providing the best relevant information, except for the Hirst Brothers’ panic grass outlined in the Service’s 12-month finding on the May 4, 2004, petition to list the Hirst Brothers’ panic grass as an endangered or threatened species. A detailed description of the basis for this finding, including a complete record of this listing determination, can be found in the Hirst Brothers’ panic grass *Endangered Species* assessment form associated with our characteristic.
