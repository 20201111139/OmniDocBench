**Background**

The sicklefin redhorse sucker (*Moxostoma sp.*), a freshwater fish species, can grow to a length of approximately 650 mm (roughly 25.6 in.). It has a compressed body and a highly falcate (sickle shaped) dorsal fin (back fin). Its body is olive-colored, with a coppery or brassy sheen; its lower fins (pectoral, pelvic, and anal fins) are primarily dusky to dark, often tinted yellow or orange; and edged (the caudal fin (tail fin) is not split; and its dorsal fin is olive in color, sometimes partially along the edge. The sicklefin redhorse sucker is known to have been collected in 1937 (based upon preserved specimens collected at the Georgia- unnamed south of Tuckasegee River and its confluence with the Tuckasegee River). It was not recognized as a potential distinctly species until 1992, when Dr. Robert Jenkins obtained and examined two specimens that had been collected in 1980 and 1982 from the Little Tennessee River by Dr. Edward Menhinick (University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina). Based on the characteristics of the specimens' lower lips, dorsal fins, and pharyngeal teeth, Jenkins recognized the species as possibly a previously unidentified species or a hybrid of the smallmouth redhorse (*M. breviceps*) and the river redhorse (*M. carinatum*). Subsequent detailed morphological and meristic studies and genetic studies have concluded that the sicklefin redhorse sucker is, in fact, a distinct species. The Service has reviewed the scientific and taxonomic literature, and is aware of any challenges to the validity of this conclusion.

The species is currently known to occupy cool to warm, moderate-gradient creeks and rivers, during all stages. In general, adults of the species are presently associated with moderate to fast currents in riffles, runs, and well-moving pools, while juveniles show a preference for moderate to deep pools with slow currents or moderate bottom and crevice cover. Adults feed and spawn over gravel, cobble, boulder, and bedrock substrates with no, or very little, silt overlay.

Past and recent collection records of the sicklefin redhorse sucker, together with what is known about the habitat utilization of the species, indicate that the sicklefin redhorse sucker once inhabited a majority, if not all, of the rivers and large creeks in the Blue Ridge portion of the Hiwassee and Little Tennessee River systems in North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. Currently, there are only two metapopulations of the sicklefin redhorse sucker known to remain: One in the Hiwassee River system and one in the Little Tennessee River system. Estimated occupied stream habitat in the Hiwassee River system totals about 310 river miles (rm). However, use of various streams/branches within these total appears to remain seasonally. Available information indicates that the sicklefin redhorse sucker uses Brasstown Creek, Hiwassee River, Brasstown Creek, Nottely River, and mid and upper reaches of the Valley River, primarily for spawning. No spawning or spawning behavior was observed within the main stem of the Hiwassee River below and lower the Hiwassee River or lower reaches of the Valley tributaries primarily from the past-spawning period (early-April to mid and early winter) to the lower un-impounded reaches of the Hiwassee Valley River, during the winter months.

The Little Tennessee River system metapopulation of the sicklefin redhorse sucker includes a total of approximately 59.5 rm of creeks and river reaches up to the shores of Fontana Reservoir, including: (1) The main stem of the Little Tennessee River in Macon and Swain Counties, North Carolina, between the Franklin (Pan) Dam and Fontana Reservoir (approximately 23.6 rm), and its tributaries, Burningtown Creek (approximately 5.7 rm) and Iotla Creek (approximately 5.1 rm) in Macon County, North Carolina; (2) the main stem of the Tuckasegee River in Swain and Jackson Counties, North Carolina, from approximately rm 27.5 downstream to Tannasee Reservoir (approximately 23.5 rm), and one its tributaries, Foray Creek (mouth of the creek), Deep Creek (approximately 2.5 rm), and the Oconaluftee River below the Bryson Dam (also sometimes referred to as the Ela Dam) (approximately 3.6 rm) in Swain County, North Carolina; and (3) sub-adults in nearby some portions of Fontana Reservoir, Swain County, North Carolina.

**Summary of Status Review**

In completing our status review, we reviewed the best available scientific and commercial information and completed the information in the SSA Report for this sicklefin redhorse sucker. For our findings, we evaluated potential stressors related to the sicklefin redhorse sucker and its habitat. The stressors we analyzed were: (1) Hydroelectric operations, inadequate erosion/sedimentation control during agricultural, timber, and construction activities; (2) runoff and discharge of organic and inorganic pollutants from industrial, municipal, agricultural, and other point and nonpoint sources; (3) habitat alterations associated with channelization and instream dredging/mining activities; (4) predation and habitat suitability impacts by nonnative species; (5) synergy and isolation of surviving populations; and (6) other natural and human-related factors that adversely affect the species habitat.

Based on the information considered in the status review for this 12-month finding, we concluded an analysis of Candidate Conservation Agreement for the Sicklefin Redhorse Sucker under the Serviceâ€™s Policy for Evaluation of Conservation Efforts When Making Listing Decisions (PECE policy), published in the Federal Register on March 28, 2003 (68 FR 15100), and lines on the ESA does not meet the policy criteria for certainty of effectiveness.

A number of less likely contributory reduction factors include alteration of the natural flow regime, and water level dynamics with the existing occupied stream and creeks. The construction of hydrological dams fragmented populations, confining spawning activity to only river reaches accessible from the two reservoirs where the species is thought to reside during lifecycle aquatic life style. The sicklefin redhorse sucker also appears to be absent from search reaches we implemented river habitat where it historically occupied the some of best habitat of the highly available with high stability of no problematic (deleterious) bar that remains perpetually cold and/or was greatly dispersing (reduced) finger, large discharge pulses of water/ hydropower production. Through efforts to protect the habitat occupied by the sicklefin redhorse sucker have been successful and important intact to future population stability in candidated populations.
