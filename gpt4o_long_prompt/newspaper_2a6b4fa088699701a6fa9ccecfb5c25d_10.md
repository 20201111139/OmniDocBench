## Finding

### Louisville Cave Beetle

Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act’s five threat factors and our review of the species’ status, we conclude that the Louisville cave beetle is not subject to the degree of threats sufficient to indicate that it is in danger of extinction (an endangered species), or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (a threatened species), throughout all of its range.

We evaluated the current range of the Louisville cave beetle to determine if there is any apparent geographic concentration of potential threats for this species. It has a relatively small range that is limited to four caves. We examined potential stressors including human visitation and disturbance, commercial and residential development, sources of water quality impairment, and small population size. We found no combination of stressors that suggests that the species may be in danger of extinction in any portion of its range. Therefore, we find that listing the Louisville cave beetle as an endangered species or a threatened species under the Act is not warranted at this time, and consequently we are removing both cave beetles from the candidate list.

### Tatum Cave Beetle

A review of the best available scientific and commercial information leads us to believe that the Tatum Cave beetle is existing, and, as such, it is not subject to the Act’s protections (an endangered species or a threatened species under the Act). Therefore, we find that this cave beetle is not subject to the degree of threats sufficient to indicate that it is in danger of extinction throughout its range (an endangered species), likely to become in danger of extinction throughout its range in the foreseeable future (a threatened species), or whether the species is an endangered or threatened species in a significant portion of its range.

Therefore, we find that listing the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle as endangered or threatened species under the Act throughout all or a significant portion of their respective ranges is not warranted at this time, and consequently we are removing both species from the candidate status list.

As a result of the Service’s 2011 multi-district litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (in re: Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation, No. 10–377 (EGS), M.D. District Col. 2016) (DC. May 10, 2011).

Out of 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service’s November 10, 2010, CNOR, this document satisfies the workshop requirements of that settlement agreement for the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle, and constitutes the Service’s 12-month finding on the May 11, 2004, petition to list the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetles as endangered or threatened species under the Act.

A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding can be found in the Louisville cave beetle’s and Tatum Cave beetle’s species-specific assessment form and other supporting documents (see ADDRESSES, above).

### Relict Leopard Frog (*Lithobates onca*)  

**Previous Federal Actions**

On May 9, 2002, the Service received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity and Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) seeking to list the relict leopard frog and designate critical habitat, because the species was either a candidate species now included in the 2006 Relict Leopard Frog Conservation Agreement and Strategy Conservation Agreement) and implement conservation actions by the relict leopard frog Conservation Team (Conservation Team), which is tied to an overall improvement in both species and habitat necessary to protect the species.

Prior to receipt of the May 2002 petition, the Service was involved in coordinated conservation efforts for the species now involving multiple federal partners and was aware of the species’ status. On June 13, 2002, the Service’s CNOR determined that the species' listing was warranted listing but that listing was precluded by higher priorities; therefore, it became a candidate species with an LPN of 6 (72 FR 64625).

In 2006, the species’ LPN was lowered to 11 and remained at that LPN through the 2010 CNOR (see September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), and November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222)).

The following year, we resumed the recovery priority rating to 2005 Relict Leopard Frog Conservation Agreement and Strategy Conservation Agreement and implement conservation actions by the relict leopard frog Conservation Team (Conservation Team), which is tied to an overall improvement in both species and habitat necessary to protect the species. On October 26, 2011 (*76 FR 66370*), we changed the species’ LPN from 8, due in part to the discovery of chytrid fungus (*Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis* (Bd)) in relict leopard frogs in 2010, and we maintained an LPN of 8 for the species through the 2015 CNOR (see November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72454), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80556)). In 2016, we continue to maintain an LPN of 8 for the species through the 2015 CNOR (see November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222)).

**Background**

Relict leopard frogs are endemic to the Colorado, Virgin, Santa Clara, and Muddy Rivers and associated springs in Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. Relict leopard frogs require reliable habitat (consisting of diverse habitat types) in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Relict leopard frogs historically occupied a variety of habitats including springs, streams, and wetlands characterized by clean, clear, and permanent waterway with cover such as submerged, emergent, and overhanging vegetation.

Monnative Predators such as Louisiana red swamp crayfish (*Procambarus clarkii*), American bullfrogs (*Lithobates catesbeianus*), and introduced bass can prey on the frogs and tadpoles and compete for food and, at issue.

The relict leopard frog currently occupies all springs-- Jemez-Linee in the Grand Canyon Supai Complex along the base of the Muddy Mountains near the Overton Arm of Lake Mead and the NBE Stegii, along the Overton Arm of Lake Mead near the Las Vegas Bay. Major challenges include small, isolated populations and low overall growth rates.

The Northshore Springs Complex and Black Canyon Spring Complex form distinct metapopulations of relict leopard frogs, wherein each metapopulation is a series of smaller, spatially separated populations that occasionally interact through the movement of individuals between them, but do not interact with the other metapopulation. Within the Northshore Springs Complex, dispersal of the grouping now appears higher pressure may exist between Blue Point and Rogers Springs. Major rains in 2006 seriously impacted the alignment of springs in Black Canyon but not between the two metapopulations.

In addition to native savories, the relict leopard frogs feed on every insect. The relict frog sites are extant or historically site as those estimated of the habitat's actual native criterion. All current breeding and nonbreeding sites are presumed stable placid natural with the assumed historical sites now known as "introductories" with more sites maintained by the National Park Service (NPS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Bureau of Reclamation (BRM), and the Service. There is low generic variation within populations.
