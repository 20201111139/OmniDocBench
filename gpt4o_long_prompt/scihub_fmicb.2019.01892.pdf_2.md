## Isolation of Bacteria and Fungi

Soil samples were homogenized and vortexed in sterile 10 mM \( \text{MgSO}_4 \) prior to isolations. Root and rhizosphere samples were vortexed after which the roots were removed from the \( \text{MgSO}_4 \). The resulting soil pellet after centrifugation (15 min, 2700g) constituted the rhizosphere fraction. Poplar roots were surface sterilized by immersing them for 5 min in 1% NaClO and bunghoass roots were sterilized with 1% NaClO supplemented with 0.1% Tween. Following treatment, all roots were rinsed four times in sterile distilled water. The last rinsing solution was plated on 869 medium (Meyer et al., 1985) to confirm surface sterility by scoring microbial growth after 7 days of incubation at 30°C. The surface sterilized roots were assembled in 15 ml sterile 10 mM \( \text{MgSO}_4 \) and mixed for 1 min using a Polytron PR1200 mixer (Kinematica AG).

For fungi isolations, dilutions up to \( 10^{-4} \) of the rhizosphere and endophytic root solutions were plated onto peptone-glucose-acid-agar medium pH 5, as described by Dietrich and Lamar (1990), and incubated for 7 days at 23°C. After incubation, all fungal mycelia were selected, purified and stored on solid malt extract [2% (w/v)]-peptone [0.3% (w/v)] medium pH 5 at 4°C.

For bacteria isolation, dilutions of the soil samples were added to a selective minimal medium (Sebastian et al., 1996) supplemented with 75 mM \(-1\) chlorendic acid as sole carbon source, or with 3 mM glucose in addition to chlorendic acid. Every 10 days, 10 ml of the culture was transferred into 90 ml of fresh medium with a slightly higher concentration of chlorendic acid, ultimately leading to 60 mg l\(^{-1}\) chlorendic acid after 3 months of incubation at 30°C and 120 rpm. At the end of the experiment, chlorendic acid concentrations were measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The diversity bacterial strains were purified and stored at -80°C.

## Identification of Isolated Bacteria and Fungi

DNA was extracted from bacterial isolates using the DNeasy® Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and from fungal isolates using the DNeasy® PowerSoil® kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands).

Soil samples (surface soil, —1, —1.5, and —2 m) and samples of root and rhizosphere of grass were taken in an area of one meter around OW149-4 and OW175-4 (n = 4). Root and rhizosphere samples of poplar were taken of the trees growing closest to the two observation wells, with four repetitions for each tree.
