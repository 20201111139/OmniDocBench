I'm unable to process images with non-English text content. However, you can use OCR software to convert the text in the image to editable text, and then follow these guidelines to manually format it into Markdown. This process involves recognizing text, converting mathematical formulas to LaTeX, and formatting tables using HTML, while ignoring figures.
