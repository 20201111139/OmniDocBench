# Federal Register / Vol. 81, No. 194 / Thursday, October 6, 2016 / Rules and Regulations

Recently, the Service’s Alabama Ecological Services Field Office learned that a specimen at the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Boston, Massachusetts, identified by T.A. Conrad as H. maconensis is not the same species that was described by Hildreth et al. (2003). Therefore, we cannot with any certainty determine the status of either the entity that Conrad (1834) first described as H. maconensis, or the entity that Minton et al. (2003) re-described as E. nelsoniodes. Additional taxonomic review, led by the Smithsonian Institution, is underway as of early 2016. The results of this review will require additional efforts to define Elliptio spp. boundaries, status, and distribution within the Black Warrior River Basin.

## Findings

The Act only allows listing of “species,” as defined under Section 3(16)—that is, recognized species, subspecies, or distinct population segments of vertebrates. Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information, and in light of the best available scientific information regarding taxonomic uncertainties, we have come to the conclusion that the black mudalia is not currently a recognized “species.” We are therefore removing the black mudalia from candidate status pending further study.

### Previous Federal Actions

The Highlands tiger beetle was first recognized as a candidate species on November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804), when we assigned the species an LPN of 2. In the October 30, 2001, CNOR (66 FR 54808), we changed the LPN for the Highlands tiger beetle from 2 to 5. The species’ imminently threatened status became exacerbated by a decrease in habitat with the acquisition of scrub habitat by the State of Florida and conservation groups. On May 10, 2004, the Service received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity and others to list 225 species as endangered or threatened, including the Highlands tiger beetle. The species was maintained as a candidate with an LPN of 5 through the 2015 CNOR (see June 13, 2002 (67 FR 40657); May 4, 2004 (69 FR 24876); May 11, 2005 (70 FR 24870); September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53754); December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034); December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222); October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66302), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 4, 2015 (80 FR 80585)).

### Background

The Highlands tiger beetle is elongate with an oval-shaped large bulging eyes, and is one of the smallest (7.0–9.5 mm) (0.28-0.37 in) tiger beetles in the United States. As typical of other tiger beetles, adult Highlands tiger beetles are active diurnal predators that use their keen vision to detect movement of small arthropods and run quickly to capture prey with their well-developed large mandibles (jaws). Tiger beetle larvae have an elongate white grub-like body and a dark or metallic head with large mandibles. Larvae are sedentary, ambush predators occupying permanent burrows flush with the ground surface. When feeding, larvae position themselves at the burrow mouth and quickly strike at and seize small arthropods that pass within a few centimeters of the burrow mouth. Larvae prey on small arthropods, similar to the adults.

The Highlands tiger beetle occurs primarily in open sandy patches of Florida scrub habitat on the Lake Wales, Winterhaven, and Polk counties. The Lake Wales Ridge is one of the largest and oldest Florida scrub ecosystems. The harsh environment on the Lake Wales Ridge is characterized by low water, nutrient-poor sandy soils, and (historically) frequent wildfires. The Highlands tiger beetle is often associated with evergreen scrub oaks, as well as high open sand with deciduous turkey oak (Quercus laevis) and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris).

High-quality habitat for the species is primarily scrub and sandhill having natural or managed-canopy cover less than 50 percent of plant cover (greater than 50 percent) that is continuously occupied by clumped scrub patches or scattered bare patches. The known extent range for the Highlands tiger beetle exists in the heart of the natural scrub-sandhill habitat of the scrub and scrub-oak part of the Lake Wales Ridge, approximately 60 km (36 mi) in width.

## Summary of Status Review

The following summary is based on information contained in our files. The Highlands tiger beetle is narrowly distributed and restricted to areas of bare sand within scrub and sandhill on ancient sand ridges of the Lake Wales Ridge in Polk and Highlands Counties, Florida. Adult tiger beetles have been found in 5 of the total 12 sites surveyed in the 6 earlier surveys. In the 2004–2005 survey, a total of 1,574 adults were found at four sites, 1,336 adults at all 7 sites were found in 1994, 928 adults at 31 sites in 1993, and 742 adults at 21 sites were found. The mean relative count of 2.231 adults was found from 6 sites in 2014. This increase in the surveyed sites can be inferred to an increase in the scrub oak area and a large number of these sites serve as additional habitats. Estimates from the visual survey show that some sites may provide an estimate of the population size if relative count method was adjusted. From the initial approval survey this site has been chosen as a site to track various changes. They are shown by reference. In addition, surveys were exhaustively surveyed in areas not otherwise studied. An estimate of these numbers likely represents an additional potential habitats added to the modified index count produces a total estimate of approximately 10,346 adults in at least 10 populations.

Based on the expanded range and insights from additional surveys by population at these sites, it is determined that the Highlands tiger beetle is more abundant in its extent of occurrence. This habitat is previously abundant that was previously documented. Of the 15 sites with the current population, 7 sites show an increase in number of individuals. The number of occupied sites classified as high or good quality also increased from 13 in 2005, to 21 in 2014, and of the currently known sites 15 are sites of high or good quality.
