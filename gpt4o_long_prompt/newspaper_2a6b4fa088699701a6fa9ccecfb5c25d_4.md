# Finding

Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act's five threat factors, we conclude that the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog does not meet the significance criterion of the DPS Policy, as detailed above, and, therefore, is not a valid DPS under our DPS Policy. As a result, we find that the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog is not a listable entity under section 4(3) of the Act. Therefore, we find that listing the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog as an endangered or a threatened species is not warranted throughout all or a significant portion of its range at this time, and consequently, we are removing it from candidate status.

As a result of the Service's 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (In re Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation, No. 10–377 (EGS), MDL, Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011)). All 251 species that were included as candidate species on or before July 12, 2011, in the CNOR, for November 10, 2010. This document satisfies the requirements of that agreement for the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog. A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding can be found in the species-specific assessment form for the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog and other appropriate documents (see Addresses, above).

## Arkansas Darter (Etheostoma cragini)

### Previous Federal Actions

The Arkansas darter was first identified as a candidate for listing under the Act in 1989 (54 FR 554); January 6, 1989, as a Category 2 candidate species. Category 2 candidate species were identified as those for which the Service did not have sufficient information indicating a proposal to list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was lacking. On February 28, 1996, the CNOR (61 FR 7596) discontinued recognition of Categories-1–3. Because further information was developed, we assigned the species an LPN of 5. In 2002, we changed the LPN from 5 to 11 (67 FR 40657; June 13, 2002).

On May 11, 2004, the Service received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity and others to list 225 species, including the Arkansas darter. The Service published a 12-month finding in the Federal Register on May 11, 2006, with a reaffirmed determination that listing was warranted but precluded and that the taxa had an LPN of 11 (70 FR 24870). We have continued to evaluate the status of the candidate taxa through our annual CNOR and maintained the LPN of 11 for the species since September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53756); December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034); December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176); November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804); November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222); October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66270); November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69993); November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 4, 2015 (80 FR 80584)).

### Background

The Arkansas darter (_Etheostoma cragini_) is a small fish in the perch family native to the Arkansas River basin. The species occurs most often in sand- or pebble-bottomed pools of small, spring-fed streams and marshes, with cool water, and broad-leaved aquatic vegetation. Arkansas darters prefer flowing, spring-fed streams or pools in contact with groundwater sources. However, the species is very tolerant to periods of very poor water quality, including low water temperatures, high dissolved oxygen, high turbidity, and hyper-eutrophication.

The Arkansas darter's range includes eastern Colorado, southwest and central Kansas, northwest and northeast Oklahoma, southwest Missouri, and northwest Arkansas. Recent surveys have expanded our knowledge of occupied Arkansas darter populations. We currently consider the estimated total of 80 populations within its range to be reasonably secure. This information has improved the assessment of the species' status.

### Summary of Status Review

In completing our status review for the Arkansas darter, we reviewed the best available scientific and commercial information and created the species information in the Species Status Assessment Report (SSA Report) for the Arkansas darter. In previous candidate assessments and findings for this species, the limited threats we considered were water depletion, water quality degradation, urbanization and development, confined-animal feeding operations, dams and reservoirs, salt cedar invasion, disease, and predation. Although isolated animal die-offs have been observed, all of these stressors (other than water depletion) occur at low levels and have not been observed to increase significantly or the overall impact at the population and species level is minimal.

Water depletion is the stressor with the largest potential impact to the Arkansas darter’s viability, affecting approximately 25 percent of the geographical range, resulting mainly from groundwater withdrawals for irrigation. Seasonal low flows and intermittency of streams are common within the Great Plains portion of its range, and it appears the species is adapted to this phenomenon. However, the continual existence of the species in these areas is dependent on localized areas of groundwater flow. In areas where groundwater flows come to the surface and create permanent pools or replenish seasonal pools along stream courses. When seasonal precipitation occurs and the streams become flowing streams typically in the spring, the streambeds remain suitable for the spawning, rearing, and dispersal of young darters. Discharge of groundwater has played a big role in projections forecast minimal change in average annual precipitation in the areas occupied by Arkansas darter and forecast reduced or diminished streamflow as a result of future changes in precipitation patterns. There do not expect to see climate-change-induced increased trends in floodplain discharge and flow lines.

Water depletion results in decreased persistence of populations at identified sites. The only range in the states where groundwater flows, western Kansas, northwest Oklahoma, and parts of Colorado, approximately 25 percent of the range. However, the species has endured over 40 years of groundwater withdrawals in these areas, indicating continued resilience. This is coupled with the large number of populations (80) spread across three multi-state areas by having a wide redundancy which is a catastrophic event crossing multiple populations in each major. Somewhere within this occupied meta populations currently occupying, the unique ecological settings of the three unique physiographic areas that this species was known to occupy historically, along with persistent threats. Despite the potential to the underlying genetic makeup to adapt to changing environmental conditions.
