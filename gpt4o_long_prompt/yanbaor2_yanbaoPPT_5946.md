### Still moving away from the middle

Consumers continue to either trade up or trade down, moving away from midmarket brands. Although globally the trade-up trend is slightly stronger than the trade-down trend, the survey results show vast differences at the country level. Last year, when we saw a marked increase in trade-up behavior among Indian consumers, we predicted a continuation of that trend—driven largely by rapid urbanization, the expansion of modern retail outlets, and premiumization in several CPG categories including beauty products, beverages, and packaged food. Indeed, the latest survey shows that India had the highest trade-up rate, at 25 percent (Exhibit 2).

Turkey and China, too, had trade-up rates of 20 percent or higher. Turkish consumers have been active up-traders over the past two years. In the 2016 the latest figures is, unsurprisingly, down slightly, due to tougher economic conditions in Turkey. In China, gains in consumer confidence have led to increases in discretionary spending.\(^2\) A mere 2 percent of Chinese consumers said they traded down.

In some Latin American and African countries, on the other hand, trade-down rates were upward of 20 percent, whereas trade-up rates were in the single digits. Consumer companies should note that in these developing economies, down-traders often opted for lower-priced branded products rather than retailer’s private-label products. Take nonalcoholic beverages, for instance: only 19 percent of down-traders in Latin America said they switched to private-label products in this category, whereas in North America, 73 percent of down-traders did so. We observed the same pattern in a number of other CPG categories, including food and household products. CPG manufacturers should therefore consider launching—and aggressively marketing—branded products in entry-level price tiers in these countries.

### What it means to be thrifty

The most prevalent changes in spending behavior varied greatly by country. Even among consumers who sought to save money, the preferred methods of doing so weren’t necessarily the same from one country to the next.

In many countries, including the United States,\(^3\) 39 percent of those who reported a change in buying behavior this year said they switched their preferred brands to those with lower prices. Compared with 2015, fewer US consumers said they waited for discounts or clipped coupons, suggesting that US bargain hunters, once they find a cheaper retailer, tend to shop more frequently there. This trend underscores the importance of channel selection for CPG companies: the handful of strong presence in channels that are perceived as low priced, such as club stores, discounters, and certain online retailers.
