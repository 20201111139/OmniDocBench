I'm unable to directly read text from images of documents. However, you can use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools to extract the text from the image and then follow the guidelines you provided to convert it into Markdown format. Here's a general outline of how you might proceed:

1. **Text Processing**: Use OCR to extract the text.
2. **Markdown Formatting**: Format the text in Markdown, maintaining headings and lists.
3. **Mathematical Formula**: Convert any formulas to LaTeX if they're present.
4. **Tables and Figures**: Handle tables in HTML and ignore figures. 

If you have the text, please share it, and I can help convert it into Markdown following your guidelines.
