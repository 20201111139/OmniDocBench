In the future, we expect human population growth and land development to be primary factors affecting habitat quality in the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker. However, compared to historical land use effects, we expect the effect of these future activities to be lessened by more stringent State and local land quality regulations, such as are required by current regulations for land and water development and agriculture, and the trend of diminishing land use in the area.

- **Land Use Practices:**  
  Improvements in land use practices are likely attributable to the modern regulatory environment that provides protection to the stream environment. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1934 (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.), North Carolina Environmental Policy Act of 1971 (N.C. Gen. Stat. ยง 113A-1 et seq.), and other regulatory actions were enacted to control the effects of land development and pollution on the aquatic environment. Historical records indicate that the existing populations of the sicklefin redhorse sucker have persisted through significant agricultural and industrial operation.

- **Future Regulations:**  
  Therefore, we expect existing regulations for land development and water quality control to adequately maintain habitat quality, and we anticipate that the species is likely to persist into the future even with expected increases in development.

- **Federal Protection:**  
  The sicklefin redhorse sucker is provided additional protection by State endangered species regulations and its association with other federally listed species. It is listed as threatened by the State of North Carolina and endangered by the State of Georgia. Both States prohibit direct take of the species.

- **Contributions in Unimproved Portions:**  
  The unimproved portions near the State line of the Tennessee & River areas where the sicklefin redhorse sucker occurs are protected. Most of the watershed is privately owned, and critical habitat for these areas is provided by cooperative agreements and conservation organizations. Disturbance to the watershed is likely limited to factors such as land development adjacent to waterways.

### Environmental Quality

We anticipate that the species will continue to have adequate water quality through modern regulatory environments designed to control sediment and nutrient loads. Additional agency actions likely to be implemented include improved water management developments.
