## Resources

Communities, including the Energy Carolinas, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, Tennessee Valley Authority, and Georgia Department of Natural Resources. A primary goal of the CCA is to expand the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker and to re-evaluate upstream reaches that were formerly degraded, but currently appear suitable. Expanding the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker into the upper sections of these watersheds will provide a greater variety of available habitat, allowing the species to more easily adjust to temporary effects of construction and landscape alteration, and providing more opportunities to use areas of refuge during periods of adverse conditions, such as periods of drought, low temperature or increased flow. Accessibility to more suitable habitats will increase the number of available spawning sites, increase opportunities for successful recruitment, and will provide alternative areas of refuge should the current spawning areas which may make these sites become unsuitable. Successfully reintroducing the sicklefin redhorse sucker by providing the species with additional rearing habitat as well as access to additional areas to serve as surrogate rearing habitats. The SSA Report for the sicklefin redhorse sucker identifies scenarios in which the future affects of the species could be accelerated by climate change or interaction among key threats. However, the SSA Report concludes that all of the threats facing this species indicates that the existing populations are stable and are likely to remain stable than most of the plausible future scenarios. In addition, while populations are currently stable and highly localized...

### Finding

Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the factors identified in the Act’s five threat factors... likely to become an endangered species (i.e., a threatened species) throughout all of its range. This finding is based on stability of the existing populations, re-evaluation of the threats that are likely to affect the populations in the future, and development of a CCA that ensures the continued participation by all stakeholders in a focused effort to address and mitigate potential threats while expanding the range and population health of the species. Additionally, we evaluated the current range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker to determine if there is any apparent geographic concentration of potential threats for the species. The current range of the species is relatively small and limited to two river systems in western North Carolina and extreme northwestern Georgia. We examined potential threats from:

1. (i) Hydroelectric operations, inadequate erosion/ sedimentation control during agricultural, timbering, and construction activities;
2. (ii) runoff and discharge of organic and inorganic pollutants from industrial, municipal, agricultural, and other point and nonpoint sources;
3. (iii) habitat and associated stream channelization and instream dredging/ mining activities;
4. (iv) predation and secondary impacts caused by nonnative species;
5. (v) fragmentation and isolation of surviving populations; and
6. (vi) other natural and human-related factors that adversely modify the aquatic environment. We found no portions of the species’ range where potential threats are significantly concentrated or substantially greater than in other portions of its range so to suggest that the species may be in danger of extinction in a portion of its range. Therefore, we find that factors affecting the sicklefin redhorse sucker are essentially uniform throughout its range, indicating no portion of the range warrants further protection due to possible endangered or threatened thresholds under the Act. Therefore, we find that listing the sicklefin redhorse sucker as an endangered or a threatened species under the Act is not warranted throughout all or a significant portion of its range at this time, and consequently, we are removing it from candidate status.

### Previous Federal Actions

Stephens ridgenose beetle (Heterelmis stephani) was designated as a Category 2 candidate in the notice published in the Federal Register on May 22, 1984, at 49 FR 21664. Category 2 candidate species were identified as those taxa for which the Service had substantial information indicating proposing to list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats sufficient for a proposed action were lacking. The February 28, 1996, (61 FR 7596) discontinued recognition of categories, so this species was no longer considered a candidate species. In the June 23, 2004, CNOR (69 FR 69405), Stephan’s riffle beetle was again designated as a candidate species as of this date, and voted to be published. On May 4, 2004, received a petition to revise the list and review the federal status to the Center for 225 plants and animals including Stephan’s riffle beetle to be designated as a candidate.

In response to the May 4, 2004, petition to list Stephan’s riffle beetle as an endangered species, we published a warranted-but-precluded 12-month finding in the Federal Register on October 7, 2013 (77 FR 24704). Subsequent warranted-but-precluded 12-month findings were published on:

- September 12, 2008 (73 FR 52946)
- December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034)
- December 9, 2008 (73 FR 75176)
- November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57982)
- October 9, 2015 (77 FR 69944)
- November 12, 2011 (75 FR 70763)
- November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69264)
- December 4, 2013 (78 FR 70104)
- September 22, 2014 (79 FR 57024)
- November 6, 2014 (80 FR 80584)
