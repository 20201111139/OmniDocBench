伯夕起作者之知有分, 且中倩斯本妙事为^桂讯, 推断的确关系句配后词成

同。卫即能足许可。臣者晞之良。伺卷据者中倩斯丽配文章似入下冲于:

1. 选择性断

这种推面常停若对一个现代人有妙甲。就是说伺停的性断, 斌可

要说性断。_喜是许股走性断_而兹面哲友长对姿门户者户, 打某言:

> **To:** According to the passage, which of the following can you most possibly watch on TV?
> 
> A. You often play football with your friends after school.
> 
> B. Your teacher has got a cold.
> 
> C. A tiger in the city zoo has run out and hasn't been caught.
> 
> D. The bike in the front of your house is lost.

无如性断事件中, 无如性事乎妙事么士。

Secondly, a news story has to be interesting and unusual. People don't want to read stories about everyday life. As a result, many stories are about some kind of danger and seem the "bad" news.

根据选路句之作司可认为性断: 电视理论事的动息匾分极只有趣味

和力平事由。答案定 C。

2. 指行性断

之细府边的约对指式视爱副探要费许疆观。费如是性偷

所性的放物。妄案在对子下木白述的副提。性员以时总的讯理, 性道

其妨和束环强这特有性的行。腿必或要对性端的哲面舍与面察—一

于须指云孺。

3. 翔理理高

这然理日体是要要实性程事阳钱保负清翼入的布高。在停

即看香宗谋性讯, 的白虑愿风动顾。
