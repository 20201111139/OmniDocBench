# Two Kentucky Cave Beetles (Louisville Cave Beetle (*Pseudanophthalmus troglodytes*) and Tatum Cave Beetle (*Pseudanophthalmus parvus*))

## Previous Federal Actions

The Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle were added to the Federal list of candidate species in the November 15, 1994, CNOR (59 FR 58982) as Category 2 species. Category 2 candidate species were identified as those for which the Service possessed information indicating proposing to list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was lacking. The February 28, 1996, CNOR (61 FR 7596) discontinued recognition of categories, so both species were no longer considered candidates and were therefore removed from the candidate list.

In the October 30, 2001, CNOR, the Service reevaluated both cave beetle species, and placed them back on the candidate list through the Service's own internal process with an LPN of 5 (66 FR 54808). The Service received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity and others, dated May 11, 2004, to list all cave beetles, including the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle, as endangered or threatened species. In the May 11, 2005, CNOR (70 FR 24870), the Service determined that listing the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle was warranted but precluded by higher priority listing decisions. Further reevaluation of these beetles addressed in this finding in every CNOR since 2002 (the October 30, 2001 [66 FR 54808]; June 13, 2002 [67 FR 40857]; May 4, 2004 [69 FR 24876]; May 11, 2005 [70 FR 24870]; September 12, 2006 [71 FR 53756]; December 6, 2007 [72 FR 69034]; December 10, 2008 [73 FR 75176]; November 9, 2009 [74 FR 57804]; November 10, 2010 [75 FR 69222]; October 26, 2011 [76 FR 66370]; November 22, 2012 [77 FR 69994], September 23, 2013 [78 FR 70104], December 5, 2014 [79 FR 72450]) and December 4, 2015 (80 FR 80584).

### Background

These two species of small beetle (0.16 in) in length, predatory cave beetles that occupy moist habitats at the cave floor surface may be transported from sources outside the cave environment. Members of the *Pseudanophthalmus* genus vary in rarity from fairly widespread species that are known from many caves to those that are extremely rare and only known restricted to one or only a few cave habits. The Louisville cave beetle is restricted to four caves in Jefferson County, Kentucky, while the Tatum Cave beetle is known from one cave (Tatum Cave) in Marion County, Kentucky.

## Summary of Status Review

When the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle were identified as candidates for protection under the Act in the October 30, 2001, CNOR (66 FR 54808), the Service considered both species to be vulnerable to toxic chemical spills, discharges of large amounts of polluted water, closure or alteration of cave entrances, and the disruption of cave energy processes by surface construction and industrial, residential, and commercial development. Our general perception was that both species were vulnerable to these habitat stressors, and we suspected that these stressors were significant and the species' overall population trends were likely decreasing. We also considered the lack of State or Federal regulations to be a major threat. As recent as the May 11, 2005, CNOR (70 FR 24870), we noted both species’ limited distribution and that they cannot avoid their vulnerability to insitu events that would have only a minimal effect on more wide-ranging members of the genus *Pseudanophthalmus*. Both species were assigned an LPN of 5. Louisville Cave Beetle and E. *troglodytes* (Eleven Jones Cave, a period of 20 years) and observed the species in three caves: Cave Research Cave, Cave Hill Cave, and Sauerkraut Cave. Given the Tatum caves (Erie Cave) (J. Krejca and B. Stickel, Service biologists, pers. comm. 2016). A large number of cave beetles, however, have been collected from locations where species of either beetle has been documented; these were preserved in alcohol from surface sources such as standing water, bottleneck pools, and well water during periods of severe drought, we observed no significant impact on the species.

The Louisville Cave beetle is small in size and generally appears to remain in some cave organisms; however, both species occur and are observed fairly regularly over time, indicating a faunal and bacterial matrix. Estimated completion in each of these locations makes it difficult, if not impossible, to precisely document trends between events; however, sections of the cave are extremely high, and there may be increased visitation of caves in both species appears to be extremely similar.

With respect to the Tatum Cave beetle, we have no conclusive evidence that the species is still extant in Tatum Cave. The species was relatively abundant (20 individuals) in Tatum Cave when first observed by C. H. Krekeler in 1957, but the species appeared to be less common in 1965, when T. C. Barr observed only two individuals. Since 1965, extensive surveys of Tatum Cave have been completed on eight separate occasions, using search techniques similar to those used by C. H. Krekeler and T. C. Barr (i.e., mechanical strainers and other available methods). The results of these surveys failed to reveal the use of the habitat that may impact the cave ecosystem and its low number of cave beetles, as demonstrated by the fact that in 2002 all specimens were placed in several locations within the last 15 years with insufficient observation and evaluations.

Despite this, there have been no observations of either species after more than 15 years of observation, indicating frequent annual fluctuations in area and abundance.

The most recent survey findings indicate that both beetles are likely in decline, although it cannot be said with certainty. The Service has concluded that the species is likely still extant, but the overall numbers present are unknown. However, given the currently available information, we do not believe that the present lack of evidence in Tatum Cave should be considered compelling evidence of extinction given the difficulty of finding the same species from the same species in a limited environment in the cave. The observed number of individuals and survey history suggest it may be appropriate to conserve the beetles, but whether these locations can be evaluated for quality is currently unknown.

The Service believes the Tatum Cave appears to be extinct. We acknowledge that it is difficult, if not impossible to observe specific populations are better than those of beetle’s apparent low abundance, the measured fact that the mere absence of local extinction by any measures is likely to obscure species occupying habitat and available scientific information described elsewhere. With respect to both opportunities to access data, we acknowledge the uncertainty. Given the uncertainty, we believe it would be prudent to assume that the species is probably extinct as none have been observed since the 1960s. 

The Service remains committed to resolving this issue and to making a timely and informed listing decision. If a Tatum Cave beetle population is found to be taken as a result, we may reconsider the species’ listings in the future.
