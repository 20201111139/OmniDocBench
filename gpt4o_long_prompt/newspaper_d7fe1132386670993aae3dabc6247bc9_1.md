The Department of Commerce will submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35).

**Agency:** National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  
**Title:** Alaska American Fisheries Act (AFA): Permits.  
**OMB Control Number:** 0648–0393.  
**Form Number(s):** NA.  
**Type of Request:** Regular submission (revision and extension of a current information collection).  
**Number of Respondents:** 253.  
**Average Hours per Response:** Application for AFA Permit for replacement vessel, 30 minutes; Application for AFA Cooperative Permit, 2 hours; Vessel Contract Fishing Notification, 2 hours; Approval as an Entity Eligible to Receive Transferable Chinook Salmon Prohibited Species Catch (PSC) Allocation, 8 hours.

In response to the American Fisheries Act (AFA), NMFS developed a management program for Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area (BSAI) pollock fisheries to include a set of AFA permanent permits. After a vessel replacement, applicants for AFA catcher/processor, mothership, inshore processors, and AFA vessels must have a valid AFA permit onboard those vessels for participation in the BSAI pollock.

Fishermen are required to have valid AFA permits onboard at all times while processing at a plant. Vessels participating in the pollock fishery without permits are prohibited. The AFA program had a one-time application deadline of October 1998. All permitted vessels are assigned to a cooperative that was already established and are issued to a harvesting vessel. Vessel and processor permits will be issued after submission of a complete AFA application.

Respondents’ Obligation:** Required to obtain or retain benefits.  
**Frequency:** Annually and on occasion.  
**Business or other for-profit organizations:** Application for AFA vessel replacement, inshore catcher vessel application, application for the inshore cooperative catch report, application for transferee of AFA permits, and entities claiming allocation of the reallocated bycatch from Chinook Salmon (PSC).

Copies of the above submissions may be obtained by contacting Jennifer Jessup and the OMB Desk Officer.
