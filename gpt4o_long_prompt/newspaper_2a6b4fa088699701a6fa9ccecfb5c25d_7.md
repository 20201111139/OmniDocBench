# Federal Register / Vol. 81, No. 194 / Thursday, October 6, 2016 / Rules and Regulations

We evaluated all known potential impacts to the Highlands tiger beetle, including the 43 sites we received. While these impacts were previously believed to pose imminent or significant threats to the species, and some may have caused the species to incur some habitat, the updated information we received regarding stressors' occurrence and population sizes has improved our understanding on how the stressors affect the status of species. In our current candidate assessment, we evaluated the best available scientific and commercial information, and concluded that the species is resilient to these stressors and that current impacts to the species are not as strong as previously believed. Approximately 43.4 percent of the existing potential suitable habitat for the species is protected conservation land. While fragmented into the Lake Wales Ridge scrub and sandhill habitats exists, 6.8 percent of the Highlands tiger beetle population occurs on these protected conservation lands, including three of the largest known populations. These lands are managed for the scrub habitat and species, including the Highlands tiger beetle, through government and private partnerships prescribed burn programs, invasive species control, best management practices, and enforcement of conservation easements, as needed. Fragmentation of the habitat was identified as a stressor for considering the dispersal capabilities of the Highlands tiger beetle populations. However, the new information on the number and distribution of occupied sites and population size indicates the threat to the dispersal capabilities of the species is not as high as previously reported. New sites have been identified in four populations across the north to south range of the species, and the Lake Wales Ridge as a whole has areas of open lands, remnant scrub and sandhill, and patchwork of scrub communities. Habitat that acts as corridors or “stepping stones” for Highlands tiger beetle movement and flight, making exchange of individuals between sites feasible for this species. In addition, storms, wind, water flow, rafting transport, and animals can assist movement or stochastic dispersal of individual beetle.

As a result of the new information and analysis, we no longer consider the threats originally identified in our previous 12-month finding for the Highlands tiger beetle to be current or foreseen threats for the following reasons: (1) The species is larger at individual numbers and occurs in more sites across its range than previously documented; (2) the populations occur primarily on protected conservation lands; (3) more than half of the potential suitable habitat for the species consists of protected land where conservation management, including nonnative plant lands and conservation banks acquired in 2014; (4) the species occurs in 16 populations across 225,302 acres (91,204 hectares) across aggregate miles (92 square kilometers), and existing unsurveyed suitable habitat occurs in the species’ range; (5) survey information has identified an increased number of sites graded as “high” and “good” quality habitat for the Highlands tiger beetle; (6) the analysis reviews annual prescribed burning schedules are being implemented across the range of the Highlands tiger beetle on government and private conservation lands; and (7) the stressors identified in the 2015 candidate assessment, including collection, occur at the individual level but are not rising to the level of population or species impacts.

Overall, current information from the 2015 candidate assessment indicate an occupied sites with a large increase in the number of sites. Most threats being addressed where management and preserving of large populations of the species occurring on protected lands and through the management activities that occur on these lands. Any actual impact from these occurs at the individual, not population or species, level, and no impact, individually or cumulatively, rises to the level that it comes to making the species meet the definition of “threatened species” or “endangered species.”

Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act's five threat factors, we find that the current stressors acting on the species and its habitat are not of sufficient imminence, intensity, or magnitude to make the Highlands tiger beetle warrant listing throughout the species’ range at this time. Because the distribution of the species is relatively stable across its range and stressors are similar throughout the species range, we found no concentration of stressors that suggests that the Highlands tiger beetle may be in danger of extinction or likely to become so on any portion of its range. With the documentation of 16 newly identified occupied sites, habitat quality, and the existing estimated adult beetle count of over 100,000 individuals in 56 sites, we find that Highland tiger beetle is no longer in danger of extinction (endangered) or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range or any portion of its range. Therefore, we find that listing the Highlands tiger beetle as threatened or endangered status is not warranted throughout all or a significant portion of its range at this time, and consequently we are removing this species from candidate status.

As a result of the Service’s 2011 multisistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to announce a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016. In the Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation, No. 1:07–cv–(SCS), MDL Docket No. 2165 (Doc. May 10, 2011), for all species that were identified as candidate species in the Service’s November 10, 2010, CNOR. This document satisfies the requirement that the Service lists and removes the Highlands tiger beetle, and constitutes the Service’s 12-month finding for the Highlands tiger beetle.

##### Previous Federal Actions

In 1975, Dietichnema hirsutii, i.e. Dietichnema hirsutii former scientific name Swallow’y Stutes House, swallow was 1 of more than 3,000 vascular plants included in a Smithsonian Institution compiled “Report on Endangered and Threatened Plants of the United States” (Report) that is were subsequently treated as petition under the Act (40 FR 27844, July 1, 1975). The Federal Register notice included D. hirsutii in the Service’s prior candidate list and consideration for listing, and the notes of endangered or threatened after as well as recognized themselves treated the proses on May 11, 2004, petition to list the Highlands tiger beetle as an endangered species. These species can be found in the Species of the Highlands tiger beetle documents section above appearing documents.

In 1980, Ponicum hirstii was considered a Category 2 candidate species (45 FR 82482; December 15, 1980, Category 2 candidate species were identified as those taxa for which.
