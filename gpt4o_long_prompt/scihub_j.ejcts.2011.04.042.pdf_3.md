The figures are given as the percentage of the denominator available.  
RV: right ventricle.

Secondary outcome measures
--------------------------

Data on postoperative RV function was available in 158 out of 161 patients. Thirty-eight patients (24%) developed RV failure. In the lower tertile group, 18.9% developed postoperative RV failure, in the middle group 24.5% and in the upper tertile group 28.8%; this was not statistically different (\( p = 0.48 \)) (Table 3).

Extreme mismatch subgroup
-------------------------

There were nine patients in whom the donor-recipient weight mismatch was 3 or greater (5.5%). By the end of the follow-up period, there was only 11% (1/9) mortality, compared with 18.2% (23/126) for those with a ratio of < 3 (\( p = 0.76 \)).

At the end of the follow-up period, of the six patients with ‘extreme’ mismatch who had been investigated with ambulatory blood-pressure measurement, only one was being treated for
