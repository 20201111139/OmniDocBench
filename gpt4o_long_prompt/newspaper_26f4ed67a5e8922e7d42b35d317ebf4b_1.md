I'm unable to directly convert PDF images to Markdown. However, I can guide you on how to do it manually. You'll need to use OCR software to recognize the text, then apply Markdown formatting according to your guidelines:

1. **Text Processing:**
   - Use OCR to extract text.
   - Structure text into Markdown with headings, paragraphs, etc.

2. **Mathematical Formula Processing:**
   - Identify any formulas and convert them to LaTeX syntax in Markdown.

3. **Table Processing:**
   - Convert tables into HTML.

4. **Ignore Figures:**
   - Don't process or describe images.

Once you have the text, follow the Markdown structure to organize it appropriately.
