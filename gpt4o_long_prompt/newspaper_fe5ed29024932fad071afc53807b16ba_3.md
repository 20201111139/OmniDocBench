# Federal Register / Vol. 69, No. 157 / Monday, August 16, 2004 / Rules and Regulations

207,638 tons of free tonnage raisins acquired by handlers from producers through the week ending June 19, 2004, plus 129,643 tons of 2002-03 carryin NS and OS late inventory, equates to 398,008 tons of natural condition raisins, or 373,136 tons of packed raisins, that are available to handlers for free use or primary markets. This is almost 130 percent of the amount of NS raisins shipped during the 2002-03 crop year (305,138 natural condition tons or 286,220 packed tons). (Obletes were included in this computation because, as previously stated, Obletes were commingled with the NS varietal type beginning with the 2003-04 crop year.)

In addition to the 10 plus 10 offers, 9,589.671 t of offer provides authority for sales of reserve raisins to handlers under certain conditions such as a national emergency, crop failure, change in economic import, scientific conditions, inadequate carryover, or if free tonnage shipments in the current crop year exceed shipments of a prior year by a specified ratio of the prior crop year. Such reserve raisins may be sold to handlers to avoid market disruptions. If implemented, the additional offers of reserve raisins make even more raisins available for primary markets, which is consistent with USDA’s Guidelines.

The Committee plans to offer 5,714 tons of 2002-03 NS reserve raisins for sale to handlers for free use pursuant to § 989.67(l). Free tonnage deliveries as of June 19, 2004, totaled 207,638 tons, which is 1,385 tons more than the 211,493-ton trade demand. Offering 3,855 tons of reserve raisins for sale to handlers for free use would allow the industry to make available the full 211,493-ton trade demand. Free tonnage shipments from August 2003 through May 2004 are 1,859 tons greater than free tonnage shipments during the same period last year. Adding the 1,859 tons to the 3,855 tons equates to a total of 5,714 tons of reserve being offered to handlers for free use under § 989.67(l).

## Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesses subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not unduly or disproportionately influenced. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the order and approximately 4,500 raisin producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.201) as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $750,000. Thirteen of the 20 handlers subject to regulation have annual sales estimated to be at least $5,000,000, and the remaining 7 handlers have sales less than $5,000,000. No more than 7 handlers, and a majority of producers, of California raisins may be classified as small entities.

Since 1949, the California raisin industry has operated under a Federal marketing order. The order contains authority, among other things, to limit the portion of a given year’s crop that can be marketed freely in any outlet by raisin handlers. This volume regulation mechanism is used to stabilize supplies of raisins and strengthen market conditions.

Pursuant to § 989.54(d) of the order, this rule continues in effect final free and reserve tonnage percentages for 2004-05 crop NS raisins. The volume regulation percentages are 70 percent free and 30 percent reserve for NS crop insurance raisins may be too numerous to any market. Reserve raisins may not be included in a factor such of the need the Committee and are disposed of through certain programs authorized under the order.

Volume regulation is warranted this season for NS raisins because acquisitions of 195,625 tons through the week ending June 19, 2004, combined with the carryin inventory of 129,345 tons, results in total available supply of 425,970 tons, which is about 100 percent higher than the 211,493-ton trade demand. (Volume inventory was derived through the 211,493-ton trade as previously stated.) Obletes were commingled with the NS varietal type beginning with the 2003-04 crop year.)

The current volume regulation procedures have helped the industry address marketing problems by keeping supplies in balance with domestic and export market needs, and avoiding market conditions. The current volume regulation procedures fully supply the domestic and export markets pursuant to market expansion, and help reduce the burden of oversupplies in the domestic market.

Raisin grapes are a perennial crop, so production in any year is dependent upon plantings made in earlier years. The unique situation of periodic raisins involves considerable risk because of variable weather patterns. Even though the prune is a mature, the industry has experienced considerable change over the last several decades. Before the 1975-76 crop year, more than 50 percent of the raisins were packed and sold directly to consumers. Now, over 60 percent of raisins are sold in bulk. This means that raisins are now sold to consumers mostly as an ingredient in another product such as cereal and baked goods. In addition, for a few years in the early 1970s, over 50 percent of the raisin grapes were sold on the wine market for crushing. Since then, the percent of raisin-variety grapes sold to the wine market has decreased. California’s grapes are classified into three groups—table grapes, wine grapes, and raisin-type grapes. Raisin-type grapes are the most versatile of the three types. They can be marketed as fresh fruit, crushed for wine making, and used in the production of juice concentrate, or dried into raisins. Annual fluctuations in the raisin grape- crop production are not synchronized with fluctuations in raisin supply. This is partially offset by the relatively large inventory of raisins in the raisin market.

Although the size of the crop, industry prices may be known, the market demand for raisins depends on the demand for crushing. This is known as the Committee’s final rule prescribes. Tasks. The supply of raisins may adjust to meet projected market instability a orderly marketing conditions.

Volume regulation is helpful to the raisin industry because it lessens the impact of such fluctuations. It also contributes to orderly marketing. For example, producer prices for NS raisins remained fairly steady from the 1993-94 through the 1996-97 crop year’s production. As shown, in the table below, carried these annuals, the industry varied from a low of 237,063 tons in 1996-97 to a high of 432,261 tons in 1994-95, or about 82 percent. According in Committee data, the total producer return on price during these years, which includes proceeds from both free tonnage plus reserve pool raisins, has varied from a low of $904.60 in 1995-94 to a high of 1.5104 in 1996-97, or a regular producer prices for the 1988-94 and 1999-2000 seasons increased significantly due to back-to-back short crops. Additionally, producer prices dropped dramatically for the last three seasons due to record.
