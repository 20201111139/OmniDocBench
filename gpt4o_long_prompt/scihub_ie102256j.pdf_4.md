Thus, a constraint of 3 mol % is defined for the maximum amount of reactants leaving the column from the top. The liquid holdups in the reactive trays are selected as 2000 mols to have reasonable liquid height. The composition of F<sub>40</sub> is 50 mol % A and 50 mol % I. Kinetic parameters of the ternary system are given in Table 5. The basic design procedure is based on the existing paper in the literature.²¹

The optimization problem for the ternary system with inert includes five design variables. These are (1) the number of stripping trays N<sub>S</sub>, (2) the reactive trays N<sub>RX</sub>, and (3) the number of rectifying trays N<sub>RX</sub>, (4) the column pressure P, and (5) the reflux R. The objective function is TAC, and the same basis of economics is used as has been used for the ternary system without inert component.

Table 6 gives the optimum design parameters and economics for the relative volatility cases considered. For the base case of α<sub>G300</sub> = 2.00, the optimum operating pressure of the column is 9 bar. The bottoms purity of 98 mol % C is achieved with a column having 7 stripping, 12 reactive, and 7 rectifying trays. The column diameter is 1.00 m with a vapor velocity of 0.56 m/s. The total capital investment for the column, reboiler, and condenser is \$352.42 × 10³, while the cost of energy is \$237.33 × 10³ / yr. Assuming a payback period of 3 years, the TAC is \$414.80 × 10³ / yr. There is a slight decrease in the operating pressure with the decrease of α<sub>G300</sub>, but the change is not dramatic. This decrease is reasonable because lower pressure helps the VLE by reducing temperatures and increasing relative volatilities. There is an increase in the optimum number of total trays with the decrease of α<sub>G300</sub>. Decrease of α<sub>G300</sub> from 2.00 to 1.75 results in a higher change in the number of separation trays. On the other hand, the increase in the number of reactive trays is more remarkable for the case of α<sub>G300</sub> = 1.50. The other design variables reflux R and the vapor holdup V increase dramatically as α<sub>G300</sub> declines. Thus, the capital and energy costs get significantly higher as the value of α<sub>G300</sub> decreases.

Figure 10 shows the temperature profiles for the three relative volatility cases. There is a sharp temperature profile for the case of α<sub>G300</sub> = 2.00. This is especially true for the stripping section. The decrease of the value of α<sub>G300</sub> moderates the sharpness of the temperature profile. The size of the hump in the reactive zone also increases as the value of α<sub>G300</sub> decreases. However, the offset does not exceed 0.1 mol % even for the case of α<sub>G300</sub> = 1.50.

The results of this ternary system differ significantly from those of the quaternary systems in terms of the actions of temperature controllers. The studies on quaternary systems concluded that the two temperature controllers had to have the same action.⁶ However, dynamically stable results are obtained for this ternary system with temperature controllers having opposite actions. Details of the physical explanation of this situation are given in a recent paper.⁸
