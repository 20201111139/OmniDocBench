### Authority for Conducting the Matching Program

The authority for conducting the matching program is 42 U.S.C. 653(j)(3).

### Purpose(s)

The purpose of the matching program is to provide each participating state agency administering TANF with new hire, quarterly wage, and unemployment insurance information from OCSE’s NDNH system of records to assist them in establishing or verifying TANF applicants’ and recipients’ eligibility for assistance, reducing payment errors, and maintaining program integrity, including determining whether duplicate participation exists in the applicant or recipient’s records in another state. The state TANF agencies may also use the NDNH information for the secondary purpose of updating the recipient’s reported participation in work activities and updating recipient and their employers’ contact information maintained by the state TANF agencies.

### Categories of Individuals

The categories of individuals involved in the matching program are adult members of households who have applied for or receive TANF benefits.

### Categories of Records

The categories of records involved in the matching program, which may contain personal identifiers, are new hire, quarterly wage, and unemployment insurance information. The specific data elements that will be provided to OCSE in a state agency input file are:
- Submitting state code (two-digit Federal Information Processing Standards code)
- Date stamp (input file transmission date)
- Adult TANF caseload month and year of adult TANF applicants and recipient
- Adult TANF applicant/recipient’s Social Security number
- Adult TANF applicant/recipient’s first, middle, and last name
- Name/Social Security number verification/request code (optional)
- Passback data (state agency information used to identify individuals on the input file but returned with the output file)

States send data in separate indicators whether the state agency requests NDNH new hire, quarterly wage, or unemployment insurance (even if that information was provided by that same state)

OCSE will compare the Social Security numbers in the state agency input file to the Social Security numbers in the NDNH, and will provide the state agency with any available new hire, quarterly wage, and unemployment insurance information in NDNH pertaining to the individuals whose records are contained in the state agency input file. The disclosure of NDNH elements that OCSE will return to the state agency are as follows:
- **New Hire File:**
  - New hire processed date
  - Employee name and address
  - Employee date and state of hire
  - Employer name and address
  - Department of Defense codes
  - Employer and state employer identification numbers

- **Quarterly Wage File:**

  - Employee name and address
  - Federal and state employer identification numbers
