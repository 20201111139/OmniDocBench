# Conservation Actions Implemented

The Conservation Team was established in March 2001, and has since met at least twice each year for the past 15 years to establish and carry forward the conservation and monitoring program for the relict leopard frog. The Conservation Team has included Federal, State, and local representatives from the Services, NPS, BLM, BR, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nevada Department of Wildlife, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources, Clark County (Nevada), the Southern Nevada Water District (including the Las Vegas Springs Preserve), the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, and the University of Nevada-Reno. The primary objective of the Conservation Team was to develop and implement the 2005 Conservation Agreement. Much conservation action occurred prior to finalization of the Conservation Agreement, and the Conservation Team developed the first annual work plan in 2003. Conservation actions continue to be implemented by partners through annual work plans. Revision of the Conservation Agreement is in development with an anticipated completion date of late 2016.

The management effort of the Conservation Team undertakes to increase population sizes and expand the distribution of the relict leopard frog. The goal for this leopard frog is to re-establish populations at natural sites, and then capture and translocate them to appropriate sites as late-stage larvae and juvenile frogs. The Conservation Team may augment any population, natural or introduction, as determined necessary to conserve the species.

### The main relict leopard frog conservation actions both those completed and ongoing into the foreseeable future, are similar:

- Remove cross-country barriers and threats to extant populations and occupied habitats.
- Create new habitats and/or create new habitats where feasible.
- Establish additional populations of relict leopard frogs in existing or created habitats.
- Manage relict leopard frogs and associated habitats to preserve intact, diverse aquatic ecosystems, and facilitate processes that promote self-sustaining populations.
- Monitor relict leopard frog populations.
- Investigate the conservation biology of the relict leopard frog, and use the results of such investigations to better meet the overall conservation goal and objectives.

## Current Analysis of Stressors Impacting the Relict Leopard Frog

In completing our status review for the relict leopard frog, we reviewed the best available scientific and commercial information, and compiled this information in the SSA Report for the relict leopard frog. We evaluated the potential threats (identified in the SSA Report as “stressors” or “potential stressors,” and consistent with the Act’s five threat factors identified in the SSA Report) that may be operating upon the relict leopard frog currently or in the future.

As required by the Act, we considered the five threat factors in assessing whether the relict leopard frog is endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of its range. We examined the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future stressors faced by the relict leopard frog. We reviewed the information available on new and unplanned projects, public/other available published and unpublished information, and we consulted with recognized relict leopard frog species and habitat experts and representatives of the State, and tribal agencies.

### Listing under the Act is warranted, based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information. We find that the stressors to the relict leopard frog are so severe, and in scope and indicate that the species is in danger of extinction (endangered), or likely to become endangered (threatened), in the foreseeable future (threatened), throughout all or a significant portion of its range.

In the SSA Report we evaluated each of the potential stressors that affect the relict leopard frog, and we determined that the following five threats are likely to impact, or may impact individuals, a specific sites, or portions of suitable habitat in the future: (1) alterations of natural spring and groundwater systems and reduced habitat connectivity; (2) overgrowth of emergent vegetation and encroachment of invasive plants; (3) adverse disturbance due to feral horse, burro, and livestock use; (4) disease; (5) population size; and (7) climate change, flash flood events, and wildfire.

Although these stressors may continue to affect the relict leopard frog, they are not causing a population-level risk to the species now or are they expected to do so into the foreseeable future. Overutilization and crayfish and bullfrog predation were evaluated in the SSA Report for the relict leopard frog but were found to result in no or low impacts, respectively, across the species' range.

Threats, or low in this summary. We have summarized the threats analysis from the SSA Report below. A complete description of those stressors and threats, and how they affect the viability of the species, is included in the SSA Report.

The effects of historical alteration of natural riverine and groundwater systems and reduced habitat connectivity to the relict leopard frog at the individual or site-specific level are ongoing, and may continue into the future.

However, there have not been any recent alterations of natural riverine and groundwater systems and reduced habitat connectivity that have affected frog populations and their habitat. Historical modification to the Colorado River system has effectively isolated the two metapopulations of relict leopard frog, and they will most likely never be reconnected. Although the two relict leopard frog metapopulations do not interbreed, their populations and most relict leopard frog introduction sites are not isolated. Therefore, many and varied ongoing conservation actions may diminish the isolation that requires range and translocation of captive bred frogs to sites suitable for relict leopard frog introduction as well as the effects of extant relict leopard frog populations that are expanding their range naturally through riverine arid and groundwater systems and reduced habitat connectivity.

But these effects are reduced in severity and do not threaten the persistence of the species. Some sites can have overgrowth of emergent vegetation and encroachment by invasive plants.

Bulrush and cattle grazing have both occurred and imparted aquatic habitat at these sites. Controlled, low-level cattle grazing lightly provides disturbance that benefits the relict leopard frog's native habitat. In many cases whereby use, habitat conditions may become degraded. Similarly, burro and relict leopard frog are having a population-level effect to the relict leopard frog or its habitat in the future. Many of these have been evaluated and monitored by the Conservation Team. The threats posed by BD, infection. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in relict leopard frogs.
