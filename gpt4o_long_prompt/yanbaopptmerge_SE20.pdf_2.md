- Assume that an error uncovered during **design** will cost **1.5** monetary unit to correct. Relative to this cost, the same error uncovered just before testing commences will cost **6.5** units; during testing, **15** units; and after release, between **67** and **100** units.

- A number of studies indicate that **design activities** introduce between **50% - 65%** of all errors during the software process. However, **formal review technique** have been shown to be up to **75%** effective in uncovering design flaws.
