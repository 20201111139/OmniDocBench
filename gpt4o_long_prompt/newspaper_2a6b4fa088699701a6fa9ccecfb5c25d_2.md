### SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

#### Background

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) requires that, within 12 months after receiving any petition to revise the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants that contains substantial information indicating that listing an animal or plant species may be warranted, we make a finding ("12-month finding"). In this finding, we determine whether listing the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog, the Arkansas darter, black mudalia, Highlands tiger beetle, <em>Dichanthelium</em> (<em>pauciclum</em>) <em>hirstii</em> (Hirst Brothers' panic grass), two Kentucky cave beetles (Louisville cave beetle and Tatum cave beetle), relic leopard frog, slickspot peppergrass, and Stephan’s riffle beetle is: (1) Not warranted; (2) warranted; or (3) warranted, but the immediate proposal of a regulation implementing the petitioned action is precluded by other pending proposals to determine whether species are endangered or threatened species, and expeditious progress is being made to remove or reduce threats to species through rescheduling of petitioned actions.

Under the Act, a species may be determined to be an endangered or a threatened species because of any of the following five factors:

- **(A)** Present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range.
- **(B)** Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.
- **(C)** Disease or predation.
- **(D)** The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or
- **(E)** Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

We summarize below the information on which we based our evaluation of the five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of the Act to determine whether the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog, the Arkansas darter, black mudalia, Highlands tiger beetle, <em>Dichanthelium</em> (<em>pauciclum</em>) <em>hirstii</em> (Hirst Brothers' panic grass), two Kentucky cave beetles (Louisville cave beetle and Tatum cave beetle), relic leopard frog, slickspot peppergrass, and Stephan’s riffle beetle meet the definition of a threatened or endangered species. More detailed information about these species is presented in the species-specific assessment forms for each species, available from _www.regulations.gov_ under the appropriate docket number (see ADDRESSES, above).

The analysis of whether any of the Act’s five factors might constitute threats, we must look to the species to determine whether the species responds to the factor in a way that causes actual impacts to the species. If the species is exposed to a factor, but no response, or only a positive response, is demonstrated, that is not a threat. If there is exposure and the species responds negatively, the factor may be a threat. In that case, we also consider a threat. If a threat would result in several threats, that may drive or contribute to the risk of extinction.

The presence of listed and endangered or threatened species as those terms are defined by the Act. This proposal necessarily requires empirical proof of a threat. The combination of exposure and severity of exposure will need to show the species is likely affected and could suffer this. The mere identification of threats is not causal of a species requiring the Act or its combination to establish sufficient to compel a finding that.
