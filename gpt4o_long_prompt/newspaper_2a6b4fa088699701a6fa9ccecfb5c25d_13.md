# Federal Register / Vol. 81, No. 194 / Thursday, October 6, 2016 / Rules and Regulations

control crayfish, maintain habitat conditions by removing excess vegetation, and inform the public about the species.

NPS and BLM authorities and regulatory mechanisms have successfully provided for and facilitated conservation of the species (see "Conservation Actions Implemented," above). NPS, BLM, BR, and the Service are signatories on the Conservation Agreement and actively involved in all actions of the Conservation Team. Each agency develops a component of annual work plans and utilizes their authority to implement conservation actions that benefit the species. Federal authorities and regulatory mechanisms have successfully provided for and facilitated conservation of the species.

We did not find any stressors examined under the Act's threat factors A, B, C, and E to rise to the level of a threat that would cause us to determine listing of the relict leopard frog is warranted. Although one or more of the stressors combined with the beneficial effects that the various conservation actions and regulatory mechanisms provided to the species, we find that the existing regulatory mechanisms (Factor D) adequately address the stressors currently impacting the relict leopard frog and its habitat.

### Regarding Cumulative Effects

There are a combination of stressors that together affect relict leopard frogs at certain sites. Overgrowth of vegetation, nonnative plants and predators, and disease acting on small populations may adversely affect relict leopard frogs. Climate change may also have an adverse impact due to the isolated distribution of most sites. Although individuals may be affected by cumulative effects in a single geographic area, there would not be population level effects to the species.

Multiple stressors on relict leopard frogs may act synergistically, exacerbating effects greater than what may be observed by individual stressors. The species is already affected by natural events such as drought and emergency wildfires and flash flood events. The presence of nonnative plants can make the effects of excess vegetation worse. Overgrowth of vegetation may reduce habitat for breeding, potentially making small populations smaller. Disease and invasive predators such as bullfrogs, crayfish, and fishes may also exacerbate the effects of small populations by removing frogs. We determined that synergistic effects may occur, though they are expected to be low in magnitude. Most individual stressors adversely affect the relict leopard frog in a single geographic area, due to the isolated distribution of most sites. Although individuals may be affected by synergistic effects in a single geographic area, there would not likely be population-level effects to the species.

To minimize or mitigate effects from stressors affecting the relict leopard frog, the Conservation Team will continue monitoring populations and implementing reintroduction programs to sites should they become greatly reduced in numbers or extirpated due to the effects of one or more stressors.

### Finding

Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information relating to the Act's five threat factors, we find that the stressors acting on the species and its habitat, either singly or in combination, are not at sufficient imminence, intensity, or magnitude to indicate that the relict leopard frog is in danger of extinction (endangered species) throughout all or a significant portion of its range, or likely to become endangered (threatened species) throughout all or a significant portion of its range.

Populations of relict leopard frogs are improving due to past conservation actions and current efforts to re-establish and increase naturally-occurring and reintroduced populations. Current and ongoing habitat management, establishment of new sites, and restoration activities have made substantial progress since their formation. We are continuing into the future by increasing and enhancing the number of frogs and habitat conditions at individual sites they occupy from year to year. We have determined that the rangewide status of the species is stable or increasing.

### After determining the species is not

endangered or threatened throughout all of its range, we then conducted an analysis to determine if it was endangered or threatened throughout a significant portion of the species' range. To do this, we evaluated whether there was any portion of the species' range where threats were concentrated such that the species in that portion would be endangered or threatened, and that portion is part of the range that would be essential for the species to be endangered or threatened. Once we determined that there was no geographic area where one or more threats would cause any portion of the species' range to be at greater risk of extinction, we concluded that determining threatened status for the relict leopard frog was not warranted. Therefore, we find that listing the relict leopard frog as an endangered or a threatened species throughout all or a significant portion of its range under the Act is not warranted at this time. And, consequently, we are removing it from candidate status.

As a result of the Service's 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016, from the annual Candidate Notices of Review. Special Deadline Litigation, No. 10-377 (DES), MDL No. 2165 (D. DC. May 10, 2011.) All 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service's international response to the litigation settlement meet the requirements of that agreement and therefore the Service is finding for the relict leopard frog that listing is not warranted September 30, 2016.

**Sicklefin Redhorse Sucker (_Moxostoma sp._)**

#### Previous Federal Actions

The sicklefin redhorse sucker was originally made a candidate species in the May 11, 2005, CNOR (70 FR 24870), and it was included in the 2007 (72 FR 69034), 2009 (71 FR 23728), 2010 (73 FR 71489), and 2011 (74 FR 57904 CNORs); and was last freenported in the completion by conservation mission in candidate notices on October 21, 2014.
