## Functional Groups in Organic Chemistry

Functional groups are the characteristic groups in organic molecules that give them their reactivity. In the formulae below, \( R \) represents the rest of the molecule and \( X \) represents any halogen atom.

1. **Hydrocarbons**
   - **Alkane**: \( R - H \)
   - **Alkene**: \( R_2C = CR_2 \)
   - **Alkyne**: \( RC \equiv CR \)
   - **Arene**: \[ \text{Aromatic ring} \]

2. **Halogen-Containing Groups**
   - **Haloalkane**: \( R - X \)

3. **Oxygen-Containing Groups**
   - **Alcohol**: \( R - OH \)
   - **Aldehyde**: \( R - CHO \)
   - **Ketone**: \( R_2C = O \)
   - **Carboxylic Acid**: \[ \text{COOH group} \]
   - **Acid Anhydride**: \[ \text{R(CO)O(CO)R} \]
   
4. **Nitrogen-Containing Groups**
   - **Amine**: \( R - NH_2 \)
   - **Amide**: \( RCONH_2 \)
   - **Nitrate**: \[ \text{R-ONO}_2 \]
   - **Nitro**: \( R - NO_2 \)

5. **Sulfur-Containing Groups**
   - **Thiol**: \( R - SH \)

6. **Phosphorus-Containing Groups**
   - **Phosphine**: \( R_3P \)
