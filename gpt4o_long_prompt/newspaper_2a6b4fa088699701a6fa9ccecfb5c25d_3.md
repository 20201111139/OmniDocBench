# Federal Register / Vol. 81, No. 194 / Thursday, October 6, 2016 / Rules and Regulations

listing is appropriate; we require evidence that these stressors are operating either to the species and its habitat, either singly or in combination, to the point that the species meets the definition of an endangered or threatened species under the Act.

In making our 12-month findings, we consider and evaluate the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the past, present, and future stressors and threats. We reviewed the petition, information available in our files, and other available published and unpublished information. This evaluation may include information from recognized experts; Federal, State, and tribal governments; academic institutions; foreign governments; private entities, and other members of the public.

## Arizona Treefrog, Huachuca-Canelo Population (Hyla wrightorum)

### Previous Federal Actions

In our combined candidate notice of review (CNOR) published on December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), we reopened the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog as a candidate for listing as a distinct population segment (DPS). Subsequently, we published similar findings in our CNORs on December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 23, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584). In 2007, the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog was assigned a listing priority number (LPN) of 3, reflecting the taxonomic identity of this listed entity as a subspecies/population with threats that we considered to be imminent and high in magnitude. The LPN numbers range from 1 to 11, with 1 being the highest priority.

### Background

The Arizona treefrog (Hyla wrightorum) is a small (4 to 5 cm, 1.6 to 2.0 inches) in length green frog with a dark eye stripe that extends from the shoulder onto the sides of the body, and sometimes to the groin area. It occurs in mixed conifer woodland and savannah, pine-oak woodland, mixed conifer forest, and Plains grasslands at elevations of approximately 1,525 to 2,530 meters (5,000 to 8,500 feet [ft]), and requires ponds for successful reproduction.

The Arizona treefrog is known to occur within Arizona, New Mexico, and Mexico. In Arizona and New Mexico, the Arizona treefrog occurs along the Mogollon Rim (central Arizona and western New Mexico), in the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills areas (a small mountain range on the Arizona-Sonora, Mexico border), and farther south in Mexico in the Sierra Madre Occidental and sky island mountain ranges). We refer to these three areas as the Mogollon Rim, Huachuca-Canelo, and Mexico populations.

### Population Segment (DPS) Policy

Published in the Federal Register on February 7, 1996 (61 FR 4722), the DPS Policy first directs the elements of the Service to consider in determining whether a vertebrate population is a DPS with respect to the Act. A population is directed as whether the population is significant. If the population is significant, then both co discrete and significant, then the DPS Policy requests the Service to evaluate the conservation status of the population to determine whether the population falls within the Act's definition of a "endangered species" or of a "threatened species."

On the basis of the best available scientific and commercial information, and in accordance with our DPS Policy, we conclude that the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog is not biologically or ecologically important to the taxa as a whole.

Summary of Findings

Based on new information and review of previously referenced studies, we find that the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog does not meet the requirements of the Serviceâ€™s Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate Population Segments (DPS Policy). This is based on the geographical expanse of the Huachuca Mutants in the Mogollon Rim and in Mexico.
