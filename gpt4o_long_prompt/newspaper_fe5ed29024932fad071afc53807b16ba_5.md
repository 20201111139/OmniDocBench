stability positively impacts small and large producers by allowing them to better anticipate the revenues their raisins will generate.

There are some reporting, recordkeeping and other compliance requirements under the order. The reporting and recordkeeping burdens are necessary for compliance purposes and for developing statistical data for maintenance of the program. The requirements are the same as those applied in past seasons. Thus, this action imposes no additional reporting or recordkeeping burdens on either small or large handlers. The forms require information which is readily available from handler records and which can be provided without data processing equipment or trained statistical staff. The information collection and recordkeeping requirements have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB Control No. 0581–0178. As with other similar marketing order programs, reports and forms are periodically studied to reduce information burden necessary under the order and improve information collection by industry and public sector agencies. In addition, USDA has not identified any relevant Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this rule.

Further, Committee and subcommittee meetings are widely publicized in advance and are held in a local accessible to the production area. The meetings are open to all industry members, including small business entities, and other interested persons who are encouraged to participate in the deliberations and voice their opinions on topics under discussion.

An interim final rule concerning this action was published in the Federal Register on April 22, 2004 (69 FR 21695). Copies of the rule were mailed to all Committee members and alternates, the Raisin Bargaining Association, handlers, and dehydrators. In addition, the rule was made available through the Internet by the Office of the Federal Register and USDA. That rule provided a 60-day comment period that ended on June 21, 2004. No comments were received.

In accordance with section 8e of the act, imported seedless raisins will continue to be subject to the same import regulations that apply to domestically produced raisins. Those regulations were issued under the United States Standards for Grades of Processed Raisins (7 CFR 52.1841 through 52.1848). The import regulations were initially issued in 1992. Imports of raisins would continue to be subject to inspection and certification by the USDA’s inspection service prior to importation or entry into United States customs territory. All raisin imports have been required to be subject to the same regulations since commission of the regulations because of the current compliance requirements.

### Fundamental Change in Asset Composition of a Bank

**AGENCY:** Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury.  
**ACTION:** Final rule.

**SUMMARY:** The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is amending its regulations to require a national bank to obtain the approval of the OCC before changing the composition of all, or substantially all, of its assets (1) through sales, or other dispositions, or (2) after having sold or disposed of all, or substantially all, of its assets, through subsequent purchases or other acquisitions of other assets or its operations. The final rule provides that, in the second case, the OCC will apply, among other factors, the same factors as it applies to the establishment of a de novo bank. This new approval requirement will enable the OCC to better assess the bank’s compliance with applicable law and whether the applicable change comports with safe and sound banking practices.

**DATES:** Effective Date: October 1, 2004.

**FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:** For questions concerning the final rule, contact Heidi M. Thomas, Special Counsel, Legislative and Regulatory Activities, at (202) 874-5090; Ronald Shimabukuro, Senior Counsel, Bank Activities and Structure Division, at (202) 874-5300; or Jean M. Kenealy, Licensing Expert, Licensing Activities, at (202) 874-5060, 250 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20219. SW.

**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:**

### I. Introduction

The OCC’s current regulations at 12 CFR part 5 do not require the approval of the OCC before a national bank substantially changes the composition of its assets through sale or other disposition, nor do they require prior OCC review or approval before a national bank character becomes a “stripped” or “dormant” bank character. Likewise, our regulations do not address an institution's large risk increase in asset size through purchases or acquisitions to engage again in the same business. On January 7, 2004, we proposed to add to our regulations a prior approval requirement for these fundamental changes in a bank’s asset composition in order to address the supervisory concerns raised by these conversions. See 69 FR 882 (Jan. 7, 2004).

As described in the preamble to the proposed rule, these conversions may produce undesirable consequences. They can increase concentration risk (especially asset composition changes as a result of divesture), and the ability of a bank management to implement new behavior banking successfully. In addition, these newly revved banks may propose to engage in activities that significantly deviate from the areas in which they are experts or experienced operators. If ill-conceived, poorly planned, or inadequately executed, these new activities can expose the bank to imprudent levels of risk, with the potential for adverse consequences to the bank's financial condition and, in the extreme situation, its viability. Even entry into lines of business that are traditional for national banks may present elevated levels of risk to a particular bank if the bank expands substantially or too quickly in those areas. In most cases, the transformation of an existing national bank into another, and its status may increase the bank's management team and the internal control systems need for the change. The preamble to the proposed rule that concerns these changes also suggests a dormant bank that a buyout necessitates the need for the OCC to thoroughly review the services and products that might be initiated by an acquiring entity.

For the reasons discussed in this final preamble, we are adopting in final form
