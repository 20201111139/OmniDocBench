Zhejiang University Theory of Computation, Fall-Winter 2015 Final Exam 1. (20%) Determine whether the following statements are true or false. If it is true write a - otherwise a × in the bracket before the statement.

(a) (  ) Let L be any regular language. Then the number of equivalence classes respect to language L (i.e. x ~L y, if for all x ∈ Σ*, xz ∈ L iff yz ∈ L ) is finite.

(b) (    ) The language {a"b"w|w E {a,b}*,n E N, and |w| = 2n} is context-free.

(c) ( ) The language {"M""w"|M accepts w in less than 2016 steps } is not recursive.

(d) ( ) The language { "M" | M is a TM and L(M) is Context-free but L(M) is not regular} is not recursive.

(e) (   ) The language {"M²"M2" | M1 and M2 are TMs, and M1 halts on e but M2 doesn't halt on e} is recursively enumerable, but not recursive.

(f) ( ) The set of all primitive recursive functions is a proper subset of the set of all u-recursive functions.

(g) ( ) Let A and B be two disjoint recursively enumerable languages. If AU B
is also be recursively enumerable, then it is possible that neither A nor B is decidable.

(h) ( ) Let H10 = {"M"|M is a TM and 10 ∈ L(M)} and T1 and 72 are recursive functions. If H10 ≤r1 L and H10 ≤r2 L, then L is recursive enumerable but not recursive.

(i) ( ) Suppose SAT <p L and L E P. Then P = NP.
(j) ( ) Let H = { "M" "w" | TM M halts on input string w}, then H is NP-complete.
