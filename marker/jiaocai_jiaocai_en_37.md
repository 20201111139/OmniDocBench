2. (18%) On FA and Regular Languages Say whether each of the following languages is regular or not regular?  Prove your answers.

(a) L1 = {w|w E {0, 1}* and w has an equal number of 0s and 1s}.

(b) L2 = {w|w E {0,1}* and w has an equal number of 01s and 10s}.

3. (20%) On PDA and Context-Free Languages Let L3 = {wca™b™|w ∈ {a,b}*, where w = w4, and m,n ∈ N, n ≤ m ≤ 2n}.

(a) Give a context-free grammar for the language L3.

(b) Design a PDA M = (K, Σ, Γ, Δ, s, F) accepting the language L3.

Solution: (a)
(b) The PDA M = (K, Σ, Γ, Δ, s, F) is defined below:
