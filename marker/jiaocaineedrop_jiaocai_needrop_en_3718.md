FLUENCY is when a child can see a word and instantly recognize it.

A child may need to see a word twenty, thirty or forty times before it becomes "automatic".  If a child has a learning disability, the number of exposures needed to automatically remember a word may go up to well over a hundred.

Tests have shown that children have about ten seconds of "working memory" - if a child can read a sentence in ten or less seconds, he/she can "get" (comprehend) the "big idea" of the sentence.

If a child has to struggle to read each word in a sentence, by the time the child reaches the end of the sentence, he/she has forgotten the words at the beginning of the sentence =
zero comprehension.

There are 220 "high frequency" words that make up 50 - 70% of almost all written sentences.

If a child can automatically read these words, then a child has a better chance of reading a sentence in ten seconds or less - and this leads to a happier, less frustrated reader
