listing is appropriate: we require evidence that these stressors are operative threats to the species and its habitat, either singly or in combination, to the point that the species meets the definition of an endangered or a threatened species under the Act.
The species are not represented, we considered and evaluated the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the past, present, and future stressors and threats. We believe that the species are not responsible for using a similar online or full, and other available published and unpublished information. This evaluation may include information from recognized by the National Science Foundation governments; academic institutions; foreign governments; private entities, and other members of the public.
Arizona Treefrog, Huachu-Caneola Population (Hyla urghitorum)
Previous Federal Actions
In our annual candidate notice of review (C NOR) published on December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), we recognized the Huachu-Caneolo population of the National Sciences of the Hauachu-Caneolo population, listing as a distinct population segment (DPS). Subsequently, we published similar findings in our CNORs on December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2008 (73 FR 75176, November 9, 2008 (73 FR 7517622), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), November 23, 2014 (78 FR 70104), November 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584). In 2007, the Huachu-Caneolo population of the Arizona treefrog was assigned a listing priority number (LPN) of 3, reflecting the taxonomic identity of the California State, and the California population with threats that we considered to be imminent and high in magnitude. The LPN numbers range from 1 to 11, with 1 being the highest priority.
The 2008 study
The Arizona treefrog (Hyla
wrightorum) is a small (4.6 centimeters \((\mathrm{cm})\) (1.8 inches (in)) green frog with a dark greythreat its extends past the shoulder onto the side of the body, and sometimes to the grain area. It occurs in Maddrean oak woodland and savannahn, which is a major threat for forest, and Plains grasslands at elevations of approximately 1,525 to 2,596 meters (in) \((5,000\) to 8,500 feet (ft)), and requires ponds for successful reproduction.
The Arizona treefrog is known to occur within Arizona. New Mexico, and Mexico. In Arizona and New Mexico, the Arizona treefrog occurs along the Mogollon Rim (central Arizona and western New Mexico), in the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills area (a disjunct mountain range on the south of the New Mexico), and the farther south in Mexico (in the Sierra Madre Occidental and sky island mountain ranges). We refer to these three areas as the Mogollon Rim, Huachuca-Canelo, and Mexico
Population
Within the Huachuca-Canelo population, historical information has documented Arizona treefrogs from the National Sciences of the Hauachuca, Fresno, Arizona, Mexico, and from 13 to 15 verified localities in the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills, Arizona. The Huachuca-Canelo population of the National Sciences of the Hauachuca, Venezuela and persist in Arizona sky island mountain range and Plains grassland habitats, and the treefrog has recently been found in new locations within grasslands and cizengas (a swamp or marsh, especially the Great Basin), and the Hacuna√ßa. These new locations in varied habitats indicate that the Arizona treefrogs may be less selective in the high altitude and the high altitude previously thought. In addition, the species likely occurs in other wet canyons with suitable breeding habitat in the Huachuca Mountains, and perhaps in cizengas in the vicinity of the Great Basin.
The Huachuca-Canelo DPS of the Arizona treefrog was originally defined based on the historical locations. The National Sciences of the Hauachuca Mountains development information on Arizona treefrog locations nearby, but outside of, the DPS area. This new information, along with many new location areas, was used to determine the National Science and Canelo Hills, indicates that the Arizona treefrog is not only more numerous, but is much more widespread than we knew when the Service made this area is a part of the A PS. There are now approximately more than 30 known localities in Arizona in the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills, with a minimum treefrog also occurs in areas outside the boundary, but within the vicinity of the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills.
Summary of Status Review
Based on new information and review of previously referenced studies, we find that the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog does not meet the requirements of the Service's Policy Regarding the Recognition of Distinct Vertebrate
Population Segments (DPS Policy) published in the Federal Register on February 7, 1996 (61 FR 4722). The DPS Policy sets forth three elements for the Service to consider in determining whether a vertebrate population is a whether a vertebrate population is a population is discrete as a whole, whether the population is significant. If the productive and significant, then the DPS Policy requires the Service to evaluate the size of the DPS.
population to determine whether the population falls within the Act's definition of an "endangered species" or "endangered species".
On the basis of the best available scientific and commercial information, and in accordance with our DPS Policy, we conclude that the Huachuca-Canelo population is a significant factor in the distribution of discrete but it is not significant (i.e., it is not biologically or ecologically important) to the taxon as a whole. Regarding discreteness, we have reviewed the best available scientific and commercial information, and the evidence relative to potential differences in physical, behavioral, morphological, and genetic attributes. The DPS Policy is a key component of the population of the Arizona treefrog is not discrete based on its geographical separation from the other two populations on the Mogollon Rim and Hauchuca-Canelo.
Regarding significance, we considered the four classes of information listed in the DPS Policy as possible to determine whether a vertebrate population, as well as all other information that might be relevant to making this determination for the Natureahuca-Canelo population. The Huachuca-Canelo population of the National Sciences of the Hauchuca-Canelo population of the National Sciences of the Hauchuca-Canelo population is exhibit any direct or indirect habitat adaptation or behavioral advantage that we would indicate that their persistence in the Huachuca Mountains and Canelo Hills are not directly available in the important to the taxon as a whole.
Moreover, we considered the other three considerations that the DPS Policy sets out, out of for evaluating significance, and that the DPS Policy is a key component of the Huachuca-Canelo population is significant to the Arizona treefrog as a whole: (1) Loss of the Huachuca-Canelo population would not result in a significant increase in the DPS Policy. Huachuca-Canelo population does not represent the only surviving natural occurrence of the Arizona treefrog; and (3) the Huachuca-Canelo population's genetic characteristics do not differ markedly from those of other Arizona treefrog populations.
