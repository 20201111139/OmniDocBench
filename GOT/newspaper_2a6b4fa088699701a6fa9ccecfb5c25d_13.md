control crayfish, maintain habitat conditions by removing excess vegetation, and inform the public about the species.
NIPS and BLM authorities and the mechanisms have successfully provided or facilitated conservation of the species (see "Conservation Actions Implemented," above). NIPS, BLM, BR, and the Service are signatories on the Conservation Act. The conservation Act of the Conservation Team. Each agency coordinates development of annual work plans and utilizes their authority to implement conservation that contains benefit the species. Federal and State agencies, including the above successfully provided or facilitated conservation of the species.
The conservation Act covers easements and measures examined under the Act's threat factors \(\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}, \mathrm{C}\), and \(\mathrm{E}\) to rise to the level of a threat that would cause us to determine listing of the relict leopard for is.

Regarding cumulative effects, there are no significant differences between the and together to affect relict leopard for certain sites. Overgrowth of vegetation, nonnative plants and predators, and disease acting on small populations may adversely affect certain populations of the species. The most important may adversely affect a site at the same time and contributes to the same nonnative plants and predators.
Reduced habitat connectivity adversely affects sites with small populations at the same time and contributes to vegetation, and nonnative plants and predators.

grow is low to moderate. Most stressors adversely affect the relict leopard for a species is not a threat to the species. A isolated distribution of most sites of the individual individuals may be affected by cumulative effects in a single geographic area, there would not be a significant effect on the risk of multiple stressors on relict gardens.
The species are not a species, exacerbating effects greater than what may be observed by individual stressors. The effects of climate change may increase the number and frequency of wildfires and flash flood events. The presence of nonnative plants can make the effects of excess vegetation worse. Overgrowth of vegetation may reduce habitat for breeding, potentially making small populations smaller. Disease and nonnative predators such as bullfrogs, or other kinds of fishes may also exacerbate the effects of the species.
removing frogs. We determined that synergistic effects may occur, although they are expected to be low in the presence of the species.

Although individuals may be affected by synergistic effects in a single species, the species are not a species that be population-level effects to the species.
The noninvasive or mitigate effects from stressors affecting the relict leopard from the Conservation Team will continue monitoring populations and reintroducing frogs to sites should they become greatly reduced in numbers or extirpated due to the effects of one or more stressors.
\section*{Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act's five threat factors, we find that the stressors acting on the species and its habitat, and the species are not a species that do not sufficient immune intensity, or magnitude to indicate that the relict leopard frog is in danger of extinction (an endangered species) throughout all of its range, or likely to become a species that will within the foreseeable future (a thresholded species) throughout all of its range.
Populations of relict leopard frogs are improving due to past conservation of the species. The relict雉 of the establishment and increase naturally occurring and reintroduced populations.
Current and ongoing habitat protection of the species are not of new sites, and restoration activities have made substantial progress since their inception are and continuing into the future. We have determined that the number of frogs and habitat conditions at individual sites change from year to year, and the number of trees are not a range.舞wide status of the species is stable or increasing.
After determining the species is not important to the species, it is not all of its range, but when conducted an analysis to determine if it will endangered or threatened throughout a significant portion of the species' range. To do this, we evaluated whether there was any portion of the species' range where threats were concentrated such that the species in that portion would be endangered or threatened, and that losing that portion of the range would cause the remainder of the species to endangered or threatened. Once we determined that there was no effect on the species that would cause any portion of the species' range to be at greater risk of extinction, then we could conclude that no portion warranted further consideration.
Therefore, we find that listing the relict局局长, who are not a species that threatened species throughout all of or a significant portion of its range under the Act is not warranted at this time, and, consequently, we are removing it to the species.
As a result of the Service's 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is not a part of the species, and the rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline 2016, 2016) (10.11.11).

for all 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service's November 10, 2010, CNOR. This is a part of the Service's 2011, 2012, and that settlement agreement for the relict leopard frog, and constitutes the Service's 12-month finding on the May 8, 2002, petition to list the relict leopard frog as an endangered or threatened species. The first report of the Service's basis for this finding, including the many effective conservation measures completed by the Conservation Team, can be found in the relict leopard frog's species-specific assessment form, SSA Report, and other supporting documents (see also the National Statistics).

On April 20, 2010, we received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity, requesting that the Service list 404 aquatic species as endangered or threatened species under the Act.
