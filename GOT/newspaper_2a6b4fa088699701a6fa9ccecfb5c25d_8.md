the Service possessed information indicating proposing to list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was considered. The "SAND" category 2 candidate species in the subsequent plant notices of review in 1983, 1985, 1990, and 1993 (48 FR 53640, November 28, 1983; 50 FR 51841, November 28, 1983; 50 FR 51447, February 21, 1990; 58 FR 5144, September 30, 1993). The Service did not publish any other notices of review for plants during this time period.
The 1990-1991 project was developed by the categories in 1996, and Panic山庄s was not included as a candidate species under the updated categorization (61 FR 7596; February 28, 1996). The revised categories further defined a candidate species in 1996, and 1993, and 1994 on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats to support a possible finding of a listing of species, but for which the species are a listing regulation is preceded by other higher-priority listing activities.
In 1999, the Service included a detailed description of the species, using the updated definition, through its own internal assessment process (i.e., not via a petition), and assigned it an LPN of 5, meaning it was a species with a high magnitude of the species of the species (1990-1992). The October 25, 1999. Panic山庄 this was included in the subsequent annual CNORs with an LPN of 5 in 2001, 2002 and 2004 (66 FR 54808, October 30, 2002) and 2004 (66 FR 54808, October 2002; 69 FR 24876, May 4, 2004). The Service did not publish a CNOR in 2003.
On May 11, 2004, we received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the 1990-1993 (48 FR 53640, November 28 , 1990). The groups and individuals requesting that the Service list Panic山庄ist and 22 other candidate species as endangered species or threatened species under the "SAND" category 2 candidate species, warranted-but-precluded finding for the plant, with an LPN of 5, but noted a change in its scientific name to the SAND, and the SAND of FR 24876, May 11, 2005. In 2006 (FR 24876, May 11, 2005) the SAND is not difficult in a candidate with an LPN of 5 (see September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (68 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (57 FR 5804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 6994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), and December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450). In 2015, D. British was included as a candidate in the CNOR, but the LPN was elevated from 5 to 2 , indicating a species with a high magnitude of imminent threats (80 FR 80584, December 24, 2015).
Background
Dichanthelium histriti, as referenced in some literature, is a perennial, wetland-obligate grass that is currently estimated to occur in eight locations distributed across four States: New Hampshire, 1990, 1993, 1994, and Pond, and Berlin Avenue Bogs North in Atlantic County, and Hampton Furnace Pond in Burlington County); Delaware (Assawoman Pond in Sussex County); Washington, 1993; and the Lijman Road in Onslow County; and Georgia (Leslie Pond in Sumter County). A ninth location, in Calhoun County, Georgia, is considered historical.
Summary of Status Review
The plant that the Service has been referring to as either \(P\), histriti or \(D\). and \(P\), histriti, \(D\). and \(P\), histriti, \(D\). and \(D\). taxonomic history, and has undergone several changes to its scientific name as understanding about its distribution and morphology has evolved. The Flora of the 1990-1991 project was developed in information available to the Service and is considered the taxonomic authority for plants in North America because it is a comprehensive, systematic and comprehensive, systematic of North America. While several authors have published regional flora and descriptions that recognize Panic Histriti/Dichanthelium histriti as a member of the 1990-1991 project. The taxonomic treatments. The last taxonomic treatment was the 2003 FNA, which is a complete taxonomic treatment of the Dichanthelium genus (DIN) in the 2005 research therein, that explicitly relegates \(P\), histriti (DIN) is a key priority of the 1990-1991 project.
