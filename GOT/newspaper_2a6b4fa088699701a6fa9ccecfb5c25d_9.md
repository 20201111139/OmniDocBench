Two Kentucky Cave Belts (Louisville
Cave Beetle (Pseudanophthalmus
troglodytes) and Tatum Cave Beetle
(Pseudanophthalmus parus)
Previous Federal Actions
The Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle were added to the Federal list of candidate species in the November 15, 1994, CNOR (59 FRG 58882) as Category 2 species identified as those taxa for which the Service possessed information indicating proposing list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data are not available in the area that there's sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was lacking. The February 28, 1996, CNOR (61 FR 7596) discontinued recognition of categories, so both species were identified as the species in the same species and were therefore removed from the candidate list.
In the October 30, 2001, CNOR, the Service re-evaluated both cave beetle species, and placed them back on the candidate list through the Service's own internal process with an LNP of 5 (66 FR 54808). The Service received a petition to provide a proposal to provide the and others, dated May 11, 2004, to list eight cave beetles, including the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetles.
In the May 11, 2005, CNOR (70 FR 24807), the Service determined listing the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle was warranted but not to be identified as those taxa. This explains. Further, we have included both species addressed in this finding in every CNOR since 2001 (see October 30, 2001 (66 FR 54808); June 13, 2002 (67 for FR 40657); May 4, 2004 (69 FR 24876); June 13, 2004 (69 FR 24876); June 20, 2005 (69 FR 24876); June 20, 2012 (69 FR 53765). December 6, 2007 (72 FR 59034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176). November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), December 10, 2011 (76 FR 66370), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584).
\section*{Background}
These two species are small (about 4 \(\mathrm{mm}\) ( 0.16 in) in length), predatory cave beetles that occupy moist habitats (100000000000000000000) and from sources outside the cave environment. Members of the Pseudanophthalmus genus vary in rarity from fairly widespread species that are found in many caves to species that are extremely rare and commonly restricted to one or only a few cave habitats. The Louisville cave beetle is restricted to four caves in Jefferson County, Kentucky, while the Tatum Cave beetle is known from one cave (Tatum Cave) in Marion County, Kentucky.
Summary of Status Review
When the Local Voisville cave beetle and the Cave beetle were identified as candidates for protection under the Act in the October 30, 2001, CNOR (66 FR 54808), the Service considered both species to be vulnerable to toxic chemical spills, discharges of large amounts of polluted water, closure or water, and the occurrence of the species. The disruption of cave energy processes by highway construction and industrial, residential, and commercial development. Our general perception was to be a major threat to the responsible debate to these habitat stressors, and we suspected that these stressors were significantly and the species' overall survival rates were observed. We also noted the lack of State or Federal regulations to ameliorate those threats. In the May 11, 2005, CNOR (70 FR 74807), we noted both species' limited distribution and the presence of the species. We also requested the vulnerability to isolated events that would have only a minimal effect on more wide-ranging members of the genus Pseudanophthalmus. Both species were assigned an LPN of 5.
Louisville Cave Beetle, and the species used to cover the last 2 years, and we found that we have provided new information on the species distribution and stressors. Based on this new information, we have re-examined the species's status and re-evaluated the magnitude of the population of the threats. This results in the results. We believe that the continued presence of P. troglodytes in Eleven Jones Cave (a period of 20 years) and observed the species in three new caves (Saurceturak Cave, Cave Hill Cave, Saurceturak Cave, Saurceturak Cave, Saurceturak Cave, the that species is more abundant and widespread from previously believed. The species was difficult to find in each of these caves (one to four individuals) and the species were found in the genus Pseudanophthalmus, which is often difficult to find and is frequently observed in low numbers. Population estimates or discernable trends for these species were reported to be due to the low number of individuals observed and the difficulty in finding specimens during repeat visits. We acknowledge that caves within the species' range likely continue to be affected by many of the same stressors identified by previous investigators. reduced energy inputs, sedimentation, pollution, and human visitation. However, we have no evidence that these stressors are operative threats that are adversely affecting \(P\). troglodytes at a population level.
\section*{Tatum Cave Beetle}
With respect to the Tatum Cave beetle, we have no evidence suggesting that the species is still extant in Tatum Cave and the species are not affected by abundant (20 individuals) in Tatum Cave when first observed by C. H. Krekeler in 1957, but the species appeared to be less common in 1965, when T. C. Barr observed only two species were found in 1965, and the species were found by the requests of Tatum Cave have been completed on eight separate occasions, using search techniques similar to those used by C. H. Krekeler and T. C. Barr (i.e., methodical visual searches of all species were found in 1965).
survey efforts also involved the use of baited pitfall traps (small cups buried in the substrate and baited with milburger and other species).
within Tatum Cave for a period of one week. Despite all of these searches, no Tatum Cave beetles have been observed in Tatum Cave since the last observation by Barr in 1965 (a period of 51 years). The Tatum Cave beetle is small in size and the size of the Tatum Cave species, however, both Krekeler and Barr were able to find the species using methodical, visual and visual characteristics. The Tatum Cave species were used (see Figure 1). The Suisseettum Cave: subsequent researchers have significant identical search methods on eight separate occasions in the exact same habitats within Tatum Cave, but no Tatum Cave beetles have been observed. The Tatum Cave beetles were not established scientific and commercial information, the Service believes the Tatum Cave beetle to be extinct. We acknowledge that it is difficult, if not to be identified as those that are, extinction. There is considerable uncertainty about the actual status of the species, and we acknowledge that, as suggested by Lewis and Lewis, there is some chance that the species remains impossible to be a major threat to the species is simply undetectable using traditional search methods. However, considering the best available scientific and commercial information, we believe that it is reasonable to conclude that the species are not affected by the consequences continued surveys for the Tatum Cave beetle in Tatum Cave, as time and funding allow. If the species is subsequently found to be extant, we reevaluate its legal status under the Act in the future.
