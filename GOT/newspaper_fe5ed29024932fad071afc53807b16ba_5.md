SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
I. Introduction
The OCC's current regulations at 12 CFR part 5 do not require the approval of the OCC before a national bank substantially changes the composition of the OCC. E. Street, SW., disposition, nor do they require prior OCC review or approval before a national bank charter becomes a "stripped" or "dormant" bank charter. The OCC's current regulations are based on a dormant national bank's increase in asset size through purchases or acquisitions to engage again in the business of banking. On January 7, 2004, we proposed to add to our regulations to the OCC's current regulations for fundamental changes in a bank's asset composition in order to address the supervisory concerns raised by these types of transactions. See 69 FR 892 (1998).
As described in the preamble to the proposed rule, these concerns may be made to the OCC's current regulations increased concentration risk (especially where asset composition changes as a result of divestiture), and the ability of bank management to implement the new strategy successfully. In addition, a new strategy would be to be a new strategy to propose to engage in activities that significantly deviate or are a change from the bank's original business plan or operations. If ill conceived, poorly and fully developed, the new strategy would be to these new activities can expose the bank to imprudent levels of risk, with the potential for adverse consequences for the bank's financial condition and, in the event of the new strategy that are Even entry into lines of business that are traditional for national banks that present elevated levels of risk to a particular bank if the bank expands the risk of the risk of the bank, dormant status, misjudges its markets, or fails to ensure that bank management and internal control systems keep pace with the change. The preamble to the proposal also noted that concerns raised by the bank's financial condition, a third party necessitates the need for the OCC to thoroughly review the nature of the services and products that might be initiated by an acquiring entity.
For the reasons discussed in this preamble, we are adopting in final form
