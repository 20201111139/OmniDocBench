Table 1 Clinical data (Rec recurrence, Mer metastasis, Pr primary, Tmf temporomandibular fossa, Smr submandibular region, \(S\) surgery, \(R\) radiation therapy, \(C\) chemotherapy, \(U R\) primary site of tumor unresectable, \(L\) regional lymph node metastasis, \(D\) distant metastasis, \(A o\) alive without disease, \(A c\) alive with disease, \(D c\) died of disease)
The most common histological type was osteosarcoma \((n=92-28 \%)\), followed by malignant fibrosis histiocytoma (MHF \((n=7,22 \%)\), rhabdomyosarcoma \((n=5,16 \%)\), fibrosarcoma \((n=3,9 \%)\), plasmacytoma \((n=2,6 \%)\), leiomyosarcoma \((n=2,6 \%)\), angiosarcoma \((n=2\), \(6 \%)\), and liposarcoma \((n=1,3 \%)\), ameloblastic fibrosarcoma \((n=1\), \(1,2 \%)\), and \(1,3 \%)\), and \(1,3 \%)\), and \(1,3 \%\) (see also in Fig. 1).
Plasticity \((n=5 ;\) Table 1 , nos. 1, 2, 6, 8, 9), osteoblastic \((n=3\), nos. 3, 4, \(n=1,5\) ), and telangiectatic \((n=1, n=0)\). N. thirabmohosozarcoma, the histological subtypes were alveolar \((n=3, n o, 17,18,20)\) and \(\mathrm{O}_{2}\) and \(\mathrm{O}_{3}\) were alveolar \((n=1, n=0)\). The results of the results were excluded from this study because malignant lymphoma is a systemic disease. Two cases of plasmacytoma were both of the solitary type, therefore these cases were included.
The results of the results of the results of the results in 15 patients. Triple modularity of S, radiation therapy (R) and chemotherapy (C) was performed in 6 , combined therapy of \(S / C\) in 4 , and \(S / R\) was in 4 . We judged that the primary tumors were unresectable in three patients. The results of the results of the results of the results of the results. Patiento radiation therapy was given preoperatively in 6 cases, postoperatively in 3 and both in 1 . The doses used varied from 18 to \(80 \mathrm{~Gy}\), with an average of \(48 \mathrm{~Gy}\). All radiation therapy was external irradiation. The fraction sizes were 2.5 Gy, treating 4 days in a 2000 patients. The results of the results of the results of the results of the results of postoperatively in 2 . The chemotherapy regimens were varied.
Treatment was determined according to the experience of the surgeon. This resulted in a lack of unity in the treatment protocol. The common disease was found in 4,16,17,18,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,53,55,56,57,58,60,61,62,63,64,65,67,68,69,70,71,73,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107,108,109,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174,175,176,177,178,179,180,181,82,83,84,85,86,88,89,90,91,92,93,100,101,102,103,105,106,107,108,108,109,110,111,111,112,113,114,116,117,118,119,121,122,123,124,124,125,126,127,129,130,131,132,134,135,136,137,139,140,141,142,144,145,146,147,149,150,151,152,156,157,158,159,161,162,163,164,167,168,169,170,172,173,174,175,177,178,179,180,180,181,82,83,84,86,86,86,86,86,86,86,181,82,83,84,86,86 100,101,102,103,104 105,106,107,108,109 101,102,103,104,105 106,107,108,109,110 101,102,103,104,106,107,108,109,111,112,113,114,114,115,116,117,119,120,121,122,124,125,126,127,127,128,129,130,133,134,135,136,138,139,140,141,141,142,143,144,144,145,146,147,147,148,149,150,150,151,152,156,156,157,158,159,162,163,164,167,169,170,171,172,172,173,174,175,178,179,180,181,82 100,101,102,103,103,104,105,106,106,107,108,109,112,113,114,115,117,118,119,120,122,124,125,126,128,129,130,133,133,134,135,136,139,140,141,142,145,146,147,148,148,149,150,151,153,154,155,156,158,159,160,161,161,162,163,164,166,167,168,169,170,170,171,172,173,173,174,175,178,178,179,180,180,180,181,82,83,184,85,86,86,86,86,86,86,90,91,92,93,100,102,103,104,105,107,108,109,112,114,115,116,117,117,118,119,120,124,125,126,127,126,127,128,129,131,132,133,134,133,134,135,136,133,134,135,136,136,137,138,139,141,132,134,135,136,140,141,142,143,145,146,147,148,147,148,149,150,152,153,154,155,157,158,159,160,160,161,162,163,165,167,168,169,171,172,173,174,176,177,178,179,181,180,181,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,189,190,191,192,193,194,195,196,197,198,199,199,198,199,199,198,198,199,199,198,197,198,199,198,199,199,199,198,199,198,199,198,198,199,198,199,191,192,193,194,199,199,199,199,199,198,198,198,199,199,199,199,191,192,193,195,
