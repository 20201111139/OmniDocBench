the reticl leopard frog, which may indicate a history of bottlenecking or small effective population size.
\section*{Summary of Status Review}
Conservation Actions Implemented
The Conservation Team was established in March 2001, and has since met at least twice each year for the past 15 years to establish and carry forward the conservation and monitoring program for the reticl leopard frog. The Conservation Team has included Federal, State, and local public health organizations, and the BLM, BR, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nevada Department of Wildlife, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the Utah Division of Conservation, and the Conservation Agency (Nevada), the Southern Nevada Water District (including the Las Vegas Springs Preserve), the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, is objective of the Conservation Team was to determine the and implement the 2005 Conservation Agreement. Much conservation occurred prior to finalization of the Conservation Agreement, and the first annual work plan in 2003. Conservation actions continue to be implemented by partners through annual work plans.
Revision of the Conservation Agreement was signed by the Department of the completion date of late 2016. Part of the management effort the Conservation Team undertakes to increase population sizes and expand the distribution of the conservation and monitoring program. Reelopard frog egg masses from natural sites, and then captive-rear and translocate them to appropriate sites as late-stage tadpoles and [juvenile frogs. The Conservation Team may augment any population, natural or introduction, and remained necessary to conserve the species.
The main reticl leopard frog research, which also both those completed and ongoing into the foreseeable future, are:
- Remove or substantially minimize threats to extant populations and occur in the environment.
- Enhance existing habitat and/or create new habitats where feasible.
- Establish additional populations of reticl leopard frogs in existing or created home.
- Manage reticl leopard frogs and their habitats to ensure persistence in diverse aquatic ecosystems, and facilitate processes that promote selfsustaining populations.
- Monitor reticl leopard frog populations.
- Investigate the conservation biology of the reticl leopard frog, and use the results of such investigations to better meet the overall conservation goal and objectives.
Current Analysis of Stressors Impacting the Relic Leopard Frog
In completing our status review for the reticl leopard frog, we reviewed the best available scientific and commercial data.
In addition to the analysis of information in the SSA Report for the reticl leopard frog. We evaluated the potential threats (identified in the SSA Report as "stressors" or "potential" for the reticlared grasses. The first year Act's five threat factors identified in the SSA Report) that may be operative upon the reticl leopard frog currently or in the future.
As required by the Act, we considered the five threat factors in assessing whether the reticl leopard frog is endangered or threatened throughout all or a significant portion of its range. We are interested in the conservation of commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future stressors lacked by the reticl leopard frog. We reviewed the information available at the site, and then provide the information, and we consulted with recognized reticl leopard frog species and habitat experts and other Federal, State, and local public health organizations. The Act is warranted if, based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that the stressors to the reticl leopard frog species are not available in the area to indicate that the species is in danger of extinction (endangered), or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (threatened), throughout all or a significant portion of its range.
In the SSA Report we evaluated each of the potential stressors for the reticl leopard frog, and we determined that the resticl garden was not only may impact individuals, specific sites, or portions of suitable habitat in the future: (1) Alteration of natural spring and groundwater systems and reduced water quality, and (2) Water quality, and other emergent vegetation and nonnative or invasive plants; (3) excessive disturbance due to federal horses, burro and livestock use; (4) disease; (5) water quality; and (6) water quality; and (7) climate change, fall flow events, and wildfire.
Although these stressors may continue to affect the reticl leopard frog, they are not causing a population-level risk to the species now nor are they expected to do so into the foreseeable future.
Overutilization and crayfish and bullfrog predation were evaluated in the SSA Report for the reticl leopard frog but were found to result in no or low impacts, respectively, across the species' range. Thus, we do not discuss the use of the reticl garden in this document. We have summarized the threats analysis from the SSA Report below. A complete description of those stressors and threats, and how they affect the viability of the species, is the most important factor.
The effects of historical alteration of natural riverine and groundwaterwater, and the connectivity to the reticl leopard frog at the individual or site-specific level more ongoing and may continue into the future. However, there have not been any recent alterations of natural riverine and water quality, and the most important habitat connectivity on reticl leopard frog populations and their habitat. Historical modification to the Colorado and Virgin rivers effectively isolated the environment of the species, and the frog, and they will most likely never be reconnected. Although the two reticl leopard frog metapopulations and most reticl leopard frog introduction sites are not available in the SSA Report. The actions by the Conservation Team minimizes population isolation through captive rearing and translocation of frogs to targeted sites. We conclude that the seedling of the seedling is a population and perhaps the species from historical alteration of natural riverine and ground water systems and reduced habitat connectivity, but these species are not available in the SSA Report. The threaten the persistence of the species.
Some sites can have overgrowth of vegetation that can have adverse effects on reticl leopard frogs that reduce the reticl garden species, and the breeding and feeding. These effects from overgrowth of vegetation are low in severity because they are reduced by storms that remove vegetation through scouring, by manual removal, and by water.
Burro and cattle grazing have both degraded and improved aquatic habitat at some sites. Controlled, low-level species, and other species are not available in that benefits frog habitat by removing excess vegetation. If grazing increases to heavy use, habitat conditions may become degraded. Similarly, burro and cattle gardening are not available in the USA population-level effect to the reticl leopard frog now or into the future.
Disease and nonnative fish predation have been evaluated and monitored by the Conservation Team. The presence of the chytrid fungus, Butrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) in reticl leopard
