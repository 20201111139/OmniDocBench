Resources. A primary goal of the CCA is to expand the range of this species upstream of barrier dams to repopulate and the water, and the degraded, but currently appear suitable. Expanding the range of the sicklefin doreous water into the upper sections of these watersheds will provide a better water quality in the water quality allowing the species to more easily adjust to temporary effects of construction and landscape alteration, and providing more opportunities to use the water quality to ensure the water conditions, such as periods of high temperature or increased flow.
Accessibility to more suitable habitat will increase the number of available water quality to ensure the water opportunities for successful recruitment, and will provide alternative spawning areas should some extent to be used to ensure the water to successful reintroduction will increase the carrying capacity of the sicklefin doreous water supply by providing species with additional riverine habitat as well as access to additional reservoirs and water quality. The water quality is a new barrier. SSA Report for the sicklefin doreous sucker noted that threats (i.e., factors affecting the species) could be considered as a source of interaction among the threats. However, the SSA Report's evaluation of all of the threats facing this species indicates that the existing populations are stable and are likely to remain stable in most of the most important areas of the water quality. While populations are currently stable and likely to remain so, under the CCA's management framework, the parties will work collaboratively to address threats in a way that reduces the likelihood that they will negatively affect the future viability of the species.
\section*{F.}
Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the act's threat for threats, we find that the stressors are not likely to be affected by either singly or in combination, are not sufficiently dimensionable, intensity or magnitude to indicate that the sicklefin doreous doreer source is in danger of the risk of water quality.
Likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (a threatened species, throughout all of its range. This finding is based on stability of existing populations, re-evaluation of threats that are likely to affect the populations in the future, and development of a CCA that ensures the continued participation by all stakeholders in a focused effort to address and mitigate potential threats while expanding the range and population health of the species.
Additionally, we evaluated the current range of the sicklefin doreous duster, including geographic concentration of potential threats for the species. The current range of the species is relatively small and limited to two river systems in the world. The most important networkers Cenogia. We examined potential threats from: (1) Hydroelectric operations, inadequate erosion/ sedimentation control during the construction of the activities; (2) runoff and discharge of organic and inorganic pollutants from industrial, municipal, agricultural, and other point and nonpoint sources; (3) habitat alterations associated with the water quality and dredging/ mining activities; (4) predation and habitat suitability impacts by nonnative species; (5) fragmentation and isolation of surviving populations; and (6) other species are not likely to be affected by the adversely ability of the aquatic environment. We found no portions of the species' range where potential threats are significantly concentrated or more likely to be affected by the water portion of its range so as to suggest that the species may be in danger of extinction in a portion of its range. Therefore, we find that factors affecting essentially uniform throughout its range, indicating no portion of the range warrants further consideration of possible endangered or threatened species; (6) water in the water (Act. Therefore, we find that it is a natural source and water) as an endangered or a threatened species under the Act is not warranted throughout all or a significant portion of its range at this time, and consequently we are removing it from candidate states.
As a result of the Service's 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the service is a major threat to the risk of being a rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline).
The Department of the 2016 D. K. Bockgroun, Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011), for all 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service's November 10, 2010, CNOR. This document satisfies the requirements of that settlement agreement for the sicklefin doreus duster, and constitutes the Service's 12-month finding to list the sicklefin dorehorse sucker as an endangered or threatened species. A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding, including the PECE policy analysis of the CCA, can be found in the sicklefin dorehorse sucker's species: specific assessment form, SSA Report, and other supporting documents (see ADR 2016).
Stephan's Riffle Beetle (Heterelmis stephani)
Previous Federal Actions
Stephan's riffle beetle (Heterelmis stephani) was designated as a Category 2 candidate in the notice published in the Federal Register on May 22, 1984, and the 1985-1986-1987. The 1986-1988-1989 species were identified as those tax for which the Service possessed information indicating proposing to list the specific species. The 1986-1988-1989 for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was lacking. The February 28, 1996, CNOR (61 FR 7596) discontinued recognition and data analysis were conducted. longer considered a candidate species. In the June 13, 2002, CNOR (67 FR 40657), Stephan's riffle beetle was designated as a candidate species as a source of information about the number of days of May 11, 2004, we received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity, requesting that 225 plants and animals, including Stephan's first report on the date of the 2016 species under the Act and critical habitat be designated. In response to the May 4, 2004, petition to list Stephan's riffle beetle as an endangered species, we published a warranted-but carefully review of the Federal Register on May 11, 2005 (70 FR 24807). Subsequent warranted-butprecluded 12-month findings were published on September 12, 2006 (71 FR 24807).

Background:
Stephan's riffle beetle is one of five known species in the genus Heterelism found in the United States. Historically, Stephan's riffle beetle occurred in Santa Cruz and Pima Counties, Arizona, the two known locations: Bog Springs, Campground and Sylvester Spring in
