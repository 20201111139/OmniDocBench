(1) when, while, as都表示“当…时”，when从可谓语动词就可以是瞬间动词也可以是逆续性动词，可用于主从同动作同时发生或从同动作先于主句动作发生。which从句谓语动词只能是逆续性动词，侧重主从句动作同时发生。as引导一个持续性动作，多用于主从句动作同时发生，强调“边…边”。 (2) until用法: 当主句谓语动词是连续性动词时，主从句都用句变式，译为“直到……为是”；当主句谓语动词是瞬间动词时，主句用否定式，从句用肯定式，即put… until，译为“直到…才”。
Mr. Green waited until his children came back. (格林先生一直等到他的孩子们回来.)
Mr. Green didn't go to bed until his children came back. (格林先生直到他的孩子们回来才睡觉.)
6.引导条件状语从句的从属连词有:计(如果), unless(除非，如果..不)等. If you don't go soon, you'll be love, = unless you go soon, you'll be late. 7.引导原因状语从句的从属连词有 because, as, since等.
because“因为”语气最强，回答why提问时只能用because，其引导的从句可放在句首或句末； as“由于”、since“疏然”语气不如 because强，引导的从句串置于句首; for是并列连词，语气最强，对前面分句加以解释或补充说明，其引导的分句带置于句末，且用语号隔开。

8.引导让步次语从句的从属连词有: although / though (虽然、尽管)，even through / 让 (即使)
