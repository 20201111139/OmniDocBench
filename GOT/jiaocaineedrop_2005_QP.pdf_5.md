Each spring requires a \(0.4 \mathrm{~N}\) force to extend or compress it by \(1.0 \mathrm{~cm}\).
(c) What steady force is needed to move the pointer \(2.0 \mathrm{~cm}\) from \(\mathrm{O}\) ?
(d) What steady acceleration is required to move the pointer in (c)?
The car starts from rest at time \(t=0\) and travels along a straight road. The accelerometer readings are recorded in Table 14.

(e) How fast is the car travelling after \(7.00 \mathrm{~s}\) ?
(f) How far does the car travel in the first \(7.00 \mathrm{~s}\) ?
(g) Aeroplanes are fitted with three accelerometers as part of their navigation equipment. Why are three accelerometers needed?
