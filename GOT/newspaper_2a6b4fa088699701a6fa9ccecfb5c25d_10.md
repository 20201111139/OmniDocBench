Finding
Louisville Cave Beehele
Based our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act's five threat factors and our review of the species' status, we conclude that the Louisville cave beetle is not subject to the degree of threats sufficient to indicate that it is in danger of extinction (an endangered species), or the most important threat within the foreseeable future (a threatened species), and throughout all of its range.
We evaluated the current range of the Louisville cave beetle to determine if the threat is not affected by the concentration of potential threats for this species. It has a relatively small range that is limited to four caves. We examined potential stressors including the threat and threat and chance, commercial and residential development, sources of water quality impairment, and small population size.
We found no concern that these species may be in the presence of species may be in danger of extinction in any portion of its range. Therefore, we find that listing the Louisville cave beetle as an endangered species or a threatened species under the Act throughout all or a significant portion of its range is not warranted at this time, and consequently we are not concerned and candidate status.
\section*{Tatum Cave Earth}
A review of the best available scientific and commercial information, leads us to believe that the Tatum Cave beetle is extinct, and, as such, it is not a major threat to the environment.
Species or a threatened species under the Act. Therefore, we did not further evaluate whether the Tatum Cave beetle is in danger of extinction throughout its range. The most important factor is the become in danger of extinction.
Throughout its range in the foreseeable future (a threatened species), or whether the species is an endangered or threatened species in a significant range.
"Therefore, we find that listing the Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle as endangered or threatened species in a significant portion of their respective ranges is not warranted at this time, and consequently we are removing both species from candidate status.

\section*{Tum-F} Previous Federal Actions
On May 9, 2002, the Service received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity and Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) seeking to list the relict leopard of design and designate critical habitat, under the authority of the Act.
The petition identified in the Tum-F, the Tum-F, and the Tum-F, and the Tum-F, have no category, historical and current distribution, present status, and actual and potential causes of decline.
Tum-F to receipt of the May 2002 petition, the Service was involved in coordinated conservation efforts for the relict leopard for mapping multiple partners and was aware of the species' protection of the Tum-F, the Tum-F, the Tum-F, and the CNOR determine the</img> of the U.S. National Ocean) warranted listing but that listing was precluded by higher priorities; therefore, it became a candidate species with an LPN of 5 (67 FR 30057).
Tum-F, and the Tum-F, were followed to 11, and remained at that LPN through the 2010 CNOR (see September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (67 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (5787 57804), and November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222)). The lower priority ranking resulted from the development of the 2005 Relict Leopard Frog Conservation Center, and the 2005 Relict Garden Agreement) and implementation of conservation actions by the relict leopard frog Conservation Team (Conservation Team), which led to an extensive review of the species' conservation and overall improvement in the species status. On October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), we changed the species' LPN to 8, due in part to the discovery of chyltrid fungus [Baterachochytrium dendrothulitis (Bd)] in relict leopard frogs in 2010, and we maintained an
LPN of 8 for the species through the 2015 CNOR (see November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584)). In 2010, we recognized the scientific name of the relict leopard frog species and other species (see November 10, 2010 (75669222)).
\section*{Background}
Relict leopard frogs are endemic to the Colorado, Virgin, Santa Clara, and Muddy Rivers and associated springs in Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. Rellict leopard frogs appear to require habitat for the species, and the habitat types (in the aquatic and terrestrial environments. Rellict leopard frogs historically occupied a variety of habitats including springs, streams, and species, and species, and species are the water with various depths, and cover such as submerged, emergent, and perimeter vegetation. Nonnative waspredators such as Louisiana red swimming and red swimming, and the species were held by bullfrogs (Lithobates catebesian), and nonnative fish are associated with extirpation of relict leopard frogs, and the species were held by the species that occur as 8 natural sites-three in the Northshore Springs Complex (along the base of the Muddy Mountains near the Overton Arm area of Lake Mead) and the Great River River (Lithobates at the National Mead). Natural sites are those sites that support wild populations of relict leopard frogs that were not established through translocation effort.
The Northshore Springs Complex and the Great River River represent distinct relict leopard frog metapopulations, wherein each metapopulation consists of smaller spatially separated populations that were found in the southern region of the movement of individuals between them, but do not interact with the other metapopulation. Within the Northshore Springs Complex, dispersal of relict局局长 (Lithobates at the National Mlleton Blue Point and Rogers Springs).
Migration and dispersal among sites also appears likely in Black Canyon but not between the two metapopulations. The species were found in the lower leopard frogs were not introduced to 5 sites, 11 of which are extant.
Introduction sites are those estimated by deliberately translocating relict leopard grasses (Lithobates at the National Mlleton Baided assumed historical range. All extant natural and introduction sites occur on lands managed by the National Park Service (NPS). Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Reclamation (BR), and the Service.
