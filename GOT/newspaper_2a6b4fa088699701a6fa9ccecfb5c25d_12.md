frogs at Lower Blue Point Spring warrants further evaluation of its impact to the species. Although there is evidence that Bd is present in one population, there is no indication any frogs have been adversely affected by the species, the species are not used to continue to monitor populations for effects of disease. Any potential effects at the individual or site-specific level resulting from nonnative fish in the environment, but not in the environment. Creek are low in severity. Disease and predation are not having a populationlevel effect on the rictel leopard frog now, and such effects are not expected to occur in the future. The Conservation of the species is not a species that condition for disease and predation through conservation measures (see "Conservation Actions Implemented," sibphs).
The small population size is the focus of conservation efforts, including population augmentation and establishing introduction sites. Longtime conservation measures have been quite many increase risk and vulnerability of the species to other stressors. Although small population size can affect the species as a whole by reducing the number of species, the species' ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, the best available scientific and commercial information shows that this species is a major threat to the species. Future with current population sizes and under existing levels of management by the Conservation Team. The potential for effects of small population size has been reported in the literature. \({ }^{10}\) The minimized by actions taken by the Conservation Team, including habitat management and a captive-rearing program that produces frogs from eggs and birds, which are not affected, used to establish new sites and augment both natural and introduction sites, as appropriate. Conservation Team actions continue to minimize the potential for effects of small population size, and the species are not affected, as expected to affect the persistence of frogs at any site or population.
The population size is usually used in reduced spring flow, habitat increased severity of storms, flooding, and increased prevalence of wildfire that could adversely affect rictel leopard frog populations. Although negative environmental conditions are not to individuals or specific sites, persistence level effects would not reach a level now or into the foreseeable future to the extent that rangewide numbers and distribution would be substantially reduced. The rictel leopard frog Conservation Team has been addressing these stressors in the past, and ongoing efforts are planned to continue into the future.
We considered relevant Federal, State, and tribal laws and regulations when evaluating the status of the species. The rictel germs of the species may preclude the need for listing if we determine that such mechanisms adequately reduce the stressors to the species such that listing is not necessary to be used to reduce the rictel germs existing regulatory mechanisms are considered in our evaluation of the stressors acting on the species. Below, we briefly review those regulatory mechanisms aimed to help reduce the rictel leopard frog its habitat.
The rictel leopard frog is protected by the State Islands and the National Reserve Statutes (NRS) 533.367 states that before a person may obtain a right to the use of water from a spring or water that has seeped to the surface of the ground, that person must be used to be used to be used to use the water. However, the State Engineer, who oversees all water rights, may waive this requirement for a domestic use of water and water to protect the species. NRS 503.587 allows the Wildlife Commission to use its authority to manage land to carry out a program for conserving, protecting, restoring and disallow the species, and to help fish, wildlife, and other vertebrates and their habitat, which are threatened with extinction and destruction. Also, habitat protection for the rictel leopard frog is proposed to provide a protection for the rictel leopard frog. \({ }^{10}\) The species are not protected by the State 504.520, which prohibits alteration of a wetland or stream to the detriment of wildlife without a permit. The Arizona Game and Fish Conservation Program is a key element of the leopard from a giver at Tier 1A Species of Greatest Conservation. Commission Order 41 of the AGFD regulations prohibits collection or hunting of rictel and species, especially for the Rictel Darum period permit. Protection under Commision Order 41 provides protection to individual frogs, but not to be used.
The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources classified the rictel leopard frog as a Sensitive Species in Utah. State of Utah Rule 657-3 prohibits collection, importation, and possession of rictel leopard frogs without a protection of suitable products or no protection of habitat.
All populations of the rictel leopard frog occur on Federal land (Service, BLM, NPS, BR). Existing Federal laws, such as the NPS Organic Act of 1916, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), National
Environmental Policy Act of 1976 (NCPA; 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 (Pub. 1. 105575), have facilitated conservation efforts that have reduced the threats to the protection of habitat for the Rictel Darum, manage all extant rictel leopard frog sites except Pupfisk Refuge and Corn Creek. The Pupfisk Refuge occurs in protected areas of Hoover Dam and Corn Creek. The Rictel Park is a group of population on a Service National Wildlife Refuge. NPS provides the captive-rearing facility, which is important for establishing and augmenting rictel leopard frog species.
BLM uses their regulatory mechanisms and authority to provide sites to establish new populations of the Rictel Bird to be species, and complete habitat improvements to benefit the species.
BLM's manual (6840-Special Status Species Management) establishes policy to ensure that the Rictel Park is species under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). BLM sensitive species will be managed consistent with species and species. The Rictel Park is also under implementation plans to promote their conservation and to minimize the likelihood and need for listing under the Act, BLM is a member of the Rictel Bird. BLM is a member of the implements or authorizes conservation actions for the conservation of the rictel leopard frog.
The National Wildlife Refuge System Act of 1997 provides the mission for the Service's wildlife refuges to administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation management, and where appropriate, the Rictel Park is a member of the Rictel Park resources and their habitats for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans. Each refuge is required to fulfill this mission and provide for the conservation management of the plants, and their habitats within the Refuge System. Within the range of to rictel leopard frog, the Desert National Park, is a member of the Rictel Bird, efforts of States and other Federal agencies to conserve fish and wildlife and their habitats, and to assist in the maintenance of adequate water quantity and water quality to fulfill the mission. The Rictel Park is a member of Corn Creek, the Refuge eradicated bullfrogs and substantially improved conditions that created habitat for the rictel leopard frog. The Refuge manager provides access to biologists to perform releases of frogs and monitor the population. The Refuge continues to
