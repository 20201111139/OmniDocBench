Computation of Trade Demands
Section 989.54 of the order prescribes procedures and time frames to be followed in establishing volume regulation. This includes methodology to be used to ensure that the Department to \(\$ 989.54\) (a) of the order, the Committee met on August 14, 2003, to review shipment and inventory data, and other matters relating to the supplies of raisins of all variable types. The Committee will be asked to explain the demand for each variable type for which a free tonnage percentage might be recommended. Trade demand is completed and approved by the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Committee and the Committee may not be applied to the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of The Committee and the Committee will be submitted to the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of The committee and the Committee will be submitted to the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of The Committee and the Committee will be distributed to the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of the Board of
any varialt type for which the computed trade demand is zero or less. The computed trade demand for Oteates was less than zero, so the Committee established the trade demand for Oteates at 500 tons. At USDA's request, the Committee met on September 9, 2003, and recomputed the combined standard of trade demand to an average 11,493 tons (210,353 plus 500).
