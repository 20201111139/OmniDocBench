Finding
Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act's five threat factors, we conclude that the Hauchauca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog does not meet the significance criterion of the DPS Policy, as detailed above and, therefore, is not a requirement for the use of a result, we find that the HauchaucaCanelo population of the Arizona treefrog is not a listable entity under section 3(16) of the Act. Therefore, we find that listing the data from the California State treefrog as an endangered or a threatened species is not warranted throughout all or a significant portion of its range at this time, and consequently, we are not required to be a result of the law.
As a result of the Service's 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing of the data from the California State fire finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline of 2016, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019), and Docket No. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011)], for all 251 species that were included as candidate species in the Service's November 10, 2010, CNOR. This document satisfies the requirements of the Service's Department of Health, Hauchauca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog. A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding can be found in the species-specific assessment form for the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog and other supporting documents (see ADDRESSES).

Previous Federal Actions
The Arkansas dater was first identified as a candidate for listing under the Act in 1989 (54 FR 554; January 6, 1989), as a Category 2 candidate candidate species. Category 2 candidate candidate species were also tax for whom the Service possessed information indicating proposing to list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological species, the species of the species is not support a proposed listing rule was lacking. On February 28, 1996, the CNOR (61 FR 7596) discontinued recognition of Categories 1-3. Because listing the Arkansas dater was presented but precluded, we assigned the species and IPN of 5. In 2002, we changed the LPN from 5 to 11 (67 FR 40657; June 13, 2002).
On May 11, 2004, the Service received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity and others to list 225 species, including the State of the Theater. The Service published a 12-month agreement was made in the Register on May 11, 2005, with a reaffirmed determination that listing was warranted but precluded and that the State of the Theater was not 24870). We have continued to evaluate the status of the candidate taxon through our annual CNOR and maintained the LPN of 11 for this year. The State of the Theater was 53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 7504), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 7504), November 10, 2010 (74 FR 7504), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584).
\section*{Background}
The Arkansas dater (Etheostoma cragini) is a small fish in the perch and the fish, and the fish is a fish, basis. The species occurs most often in sand- or peble-boltenod pools of small, spring-fed streams and marshes, with cool water, and broad-leaved aquatic vegetation. Arkansas darters were placed on the fish, and the fish is a fish pools in contact with groundwater sources. However, the species is very tolerant to periods of very poor water quality, including high water temperatures, low dissolved oxygen, high turbidity, and hypercycling.
The Arkansas dater's range includes eastern Colorado, southwest and central to the鱼鱼, and the鱼鱼, and the鱼鱼, and Oklahoma, southwest Missouri, and northwest Arkansas. Recent surveys have expanded our knowledge of occupied Arkansas dater populations, including the鱼鱼, and the鱼鱼, and the鱼鱼, and the total of 80 populations within 15 time populations rangewide. This is more than we knew of for previous assessments of this species.
Summary of Status Review
In completing our status review for the Arkansas dater, we reviewed the best available scientific and commercial information concerning information in the Species Status Assessment Report (SSA Report) for the Arkansas dater. In previous candidate assessments and findings for this species, the identified threats were considered were water depletion, water quality degradation, urbanization and development, confined-animal feeding operations, dams and reservoirs, salt cedar invasion, disease, and predation.
Although localized negative effects have been observed, all of these stressors (other than water depletion) occur at a limited scale and scope, and the overall number of population and species level is minimal.
Water depletion is the stressor with the largest potential impact to the water quality of the water quality. The approximately 25 percent of the geographic range, resulting mainly from groundwater withdrawals for agriculture. Seasonal low flows and water quality were 177. The within the Great Plains portion of its range, and it appears the species is adapted to this phenomenon. However, the continued existence of the species in the same range is not a significant increase of refugia. Typically refugia exist where groundwater flows come to the surface and create permanent pools or small wetland areas along the stream. The water quality of the water quality occurs and the streams become flowing systems, typically in the spring, the stream then provides habitat for spawning, rearing, and dispersal of young and adult individuals throughout the country. The water quality also also projections forecast minimal change in average annual precipitation in the Arkansas River basin and do not occur in the range of the stream. The streamflow as a result of future changes in precipitation patterns. Therefore, we do not expect to see climate-change, driven decreased trends in precipitation and precipitation.
Water depletion results in decreased resiliency of populations affected in the portions of the range in southwestern Kansas, northwestern Oklahoma, and the northern Tennessee. The water control percent of the range. However, the species has endured over 40 years of groundwater withdrawals in these areas, indicating continued resiliency of these areas. The water quality of the population was 600 populations (80) spread across the multi-State range provides the Arkansas dater species with a high level of redundancy should a catastrophic event in the region of the period and required range. Multiple populations occupying the unique ecological settings of the three unique physiogeographic areas, the same physiogeographic areas that are not affected by the historically, allow the species to maintain adaptive potential and the underlying genetic makeup to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Over the next 30 years, under our expected scenario, we are likely to see
