Lactoferrin has been associated with insulin sensitivity in vivo and in vitro studies. We aimed to test the effects of lactoferrin on human subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes. Human subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes were cultured with increasing lactoferrin (hLf, 0.1, 1, \(10 \mu \mathrm{M}\) ) under differentiation conditions. The effects of lactoferrin on adipogenesis were studied through the expression of different adipogenic and inflammatory markers, AMPK activation and Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) activity. The response to insulin was evaluated through \({ }^{566473} \mathrm{AKT}\) phosphorylation. In both subcutaneous and visceral preadipocytes, lactoferrin (1 and \(10 \mu \mathrm{M}\) ) increased adipogenic gene expressions and protein levels (fatty acid synthase, PPAR \(\gamma\), FABP4, ADIPOQ, ACC and STAMP2) and decreased inflammatory markers (IL8, lid and CAPI) 0.56 -dependently in parallel to increased insulin-induced \({ }^{566473} \mathrm{AKT}\) phosphorylation. In addition to these adipogenic effects, lactoferrin decreased significantly AMPK activity (reducing \({ }^{566473} \mathrm{AMPK}\) and \({ }^{566793} \mathrm{ACC}\) ) and RB1 activity (increasing the \({ }^{566673} \mathrm{BR} 1 / \mathrm{BR} 1\) ) ratio). In conclusion, these results suggest that lactoferrin promotes adipogenesis in human adipocytes by enhancing insulin signaling and inhibiting RB1 and AMPK activities.

\section*{1. Introduction}
Adipose tissue is recognized as an endocrine organ that plays an important role in human diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer. Adipogenesis can be divided in two stages: adipocyte commitment of the cell, and the cell, and the cell, and the cell, and the cell, and the cell, or adipocytes. Adipocyte commitment under tissue culture conditions is achieved by cell confluency. Cells under high confluency can be further induced to become mature adipocytes by various adipogenic inducers. Transcriptional pathways important for the later stages of adipogenesis have been extensively studied. In particular, several key transcription factors such as PPAR \(\gamma\) and members of the C/EBP protein family play pivotal roles in dictating cascades of transcriptional activation required for establishing the terminally differentiated state \([1,\). The negative effects of inflammatory mediators on adipocyte

differentiation has been extensively reported [3,, leading to concomitant blunting of insulin action.
Lactoferrin is a pleiotropic glycoprotein \((80 \mathrm{kDa})\) and a prominent component of the first line of mammalian host defense, acting on specific lactoferrin receptors that exist in a variety of cells, like the cell, and the cell, and the cell, and the cell, and the cell, are regulated in response to inflammatory stimuli . Lactoferrin is able to bind and buffer several pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as lipopolysaccharide, viral components and soluble components of the extracellular matrix . This ability is associated with the putative lactoferrin anti-inflammatory activity, as demonstrated in several studies [7-. Lactoferrin also participates in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation [11., In primary osteoblasts, lactoferrin stimulated proliferation and differentiation and acted as a survival factor in the human brain. The effect of the survival of the survival process induced by serum withdrawal and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis in a murine bone marrow culture . Recently, we have reported that lactoferrin is associated with insulin sensitivity in vivo in humans and in vitro (increasing \({ }^{4788 \mathrm{~m}} \mathrm{AKT}\) phosphorylation) in HepG2 and 373-1 cell lines. We also showed that lactoferrin inhibited adipogenesis in 373-1 cell line cell through the increase of AMPK and Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) activity [14,.
Lactoferrin is found in considerable concentrations in breast milk (1 \(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml})\) and in colströmum \((7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml})\). If \(\mathrm{S}\) is a natural component of breast milk which is ingested by infants. Lactoferrin administration in
