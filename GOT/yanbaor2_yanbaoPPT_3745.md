By contrast, in China, consumers were less likely to switch stores to save money, instead, they opted to buy their preferred brand in smaller quantities.

In Central and West Africa, Nestle launched an initiative called My Own Business, through which entrepreneurs sell that coffee by the cup from specially designed backpacks.

The waning appeal of 'natural' and 'organic'

However, the latest survey results also show that consumers today aren't necessarily equating healthy eating with buying products that are labelled "natural" or "organic."
In Western Europe, there is still some growth in natural and organic products. For example, in Italy and France, survey respondents who claimed to have increased their purchases of natural and organic products outnumbered those who said they're reduced such purchases, by 15 percent. Western European consumers are also continuing to show greater interest in buying locally sourced food.

Some consumers eat only dairy-free foods. Other food lifestyles include gluten-free, vegetarian, and paleo.
