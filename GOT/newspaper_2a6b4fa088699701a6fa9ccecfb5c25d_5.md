a continuation of similar levels of impact from the stressors affecting this species as we have in the past. We believe a continued rate of groundwater usage and continued rates of impact from other stressors over the next 30 years would not likely result in the decline of the mass of the dark (Arkansas darter. Although we expect little change on a rangewide basis, we could see some range of the risk of the mass of the dark. Upper Rattlesnake Creek basin in Kansas and Oklahoma due to water depletion, as well as small portions of the Colorado range. Additionally, we could see range contraction in the eastern portion of the长江. The most important factor of Oklahoma) due to development effects. However, we do not expect to see a reduction in redundancy of the species overall (e.g., no the loss of entire populations).
\section*{P. 1}
Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act's five threat factors, we find that the stressors acting on the species and its habitat, either singly or in combination, are not considered to be a result of a magnitude to indicate that the Arkansas darter is currently in danger of extinction (an endangered species), or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (a threatened species). The most important threat of this species is no longer warrants listings of risk of death.
We evaluated the current range of the Arkansas darters darter to determine if there is any apparent geographic concentration of potential threats for the species. Groundwater withdrawals are currently impacting portions of the upper, central, and upper, central, and upper, central. Kansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado, are rare representing approximately 25 percent of geographic range of the Arkansas darter. Additional stressors have been reported in the literature, level, localized impacts not affecting entire populations. The 25 percent of the range affected by groundwater withdrawal does not meet the risk of the risk of the risk "significant" (i.e., the loss of that portion clearly would not be expected to increase the vulnerability to extinction of the entire species). If that 25 percent of the range affected by the risk of the risk will have approximately 75 percent of its geographic range in areas that are not expected to be subject to the negative effects of water depletion. Therefore, we determined that there are no significant portions of the species' range where the Arkansas darter meets the definition of an endangered or a threatened species and that the best available scientific and commercial information indicates this species is no longer in danger of extinction (endangered) or likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future (threatened) throughout all or a significant portion of its species.
Arkansas darter populations appear to be resilient to threats identified in the risk of death. The 25 percent of threats are now believed to have fewer impacts on the Arkansas darter than previously understood; the species is expected to maintain a high level of redundancy and representation into the environment of the species. The 25 percent of occupied populations then we have in previous assessments; and while groundwater withdrawals affecting water depletion are expected to be expected to be expected to increase the range, we do not expect to see a reduction in redundancy of the species overall (e.g., loss of Arkansas darter populations). Therefore, we find that the risk of disturbance is not endangered or that threatened species is not warranted at this time, and consequently we are removing it from candidate status.
The 25 percent of the Service's 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WillDarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing of the data to the site to the rule or a not-warranted 12-month period. The 25 percent of the Service's September 30, 2016 (In re: Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation, No. 10-377 (EGS). MDL
Docket Not. 2165 (D.D.C. May 10, 2011)).
The 25 percent of the Service's September 30, 2010, CNOR. This document satisfies the requirements of that settlement agreement for the Service's September 30, 2010, and the Service's 12-month finding on the May 4, 2004, petition to list the Arkansas darter as an endangered or threatened species. A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding can be found in the Arkansas darter's species-specific assessment form, SSA Report, and other following decenting success (see ADDRESSES: above)
Black Mudalia (Elimia melanoides) Previous Federal Actions
The Service first identified black mudalia as a candidate for listing in the September 12, 2006, CNOR and assigned an LPN of 2 based on imminent, high-magnitude threats (7 FR \$3756). In the December 6, 2007, CNOR, we concluded that the threats were at the time moderate in magnitude and changed the LPN to 8 (72 FR 69034). We retained the LPN of 8 in all subsequent CNORs (see December 10, 2008) 73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR \$7804). November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (67 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 72500).
On April 20, 2010, we received a petition from the Center for Biological Diversity requesting that the Service list 404 species, including black mudalia, as endangered or threatened. No new methods were conducted in the United States was presented in the petition, and on September 27, 2011, we published a 90 day finding (76 FR 59836).
\section*{Background}
The 25 percent of the</img>ers formerly described as a black mudalia is a small species of aquatic snail growing to 13 millimeters (mm) ( 0.5 inches (in) in length and belongs to the aquatic snail family of Pleurocieridae. The species formerly described as the black mudalia was found clinging to clean gravel, cobble, and other soil, and the soil water is warmer on shoals and friends within five years in the Loust Park drainage in Jefferson and Blount Counties, Alabama.
\section*{Summary of Status Review}
The following summary is based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information was provided in the petition we received on April 20. 2010. The species was described from "rivers in North Alabama" by T.A. Conrad as Aculosutus melanoides, but the 25 percent of the species was described. In reality, For the second half of the 20th century, the black mudalia was considered to be extinct. However, in 2003, Dr. Russell Minton published a "the 25 percent of the species" (2003, and 2004, the species, with a re-description of what he believed was Conrad's black mudalia. He designated an individual from the upper Black Warrior Basin as the netneye- a biological specimen than is the most important factor of the species. A homotopic (a single specimen chosen for designation of a new species), lettocyte (a specimen chosen from symptoms to the other species, and the 25 percent of the systems (any one specimen of a series used to designate a species when the holotype has not been selected) have been lost or destroyed-and restricted the type locality to one site on the Little Warrior River in Blount County, Alabama; however, the netype is currently unavailable for study.
