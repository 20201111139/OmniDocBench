the Service possessed information indicating proposing to list the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was lacking. _Panicum histii_ remained a Category 2 candidate species in the subsequent plant notices of review in 1983, 1985, 1990, and 1993 (48 FR 53640, November 28, 1983; 50 FR 39526, September 27, 1985; 55 FR 6184, February 21, 1990; 56 FR 51144, September 30, 1993). The Service did not publish any other notices of review for plants during this time period.

The Service revised candidate categories in 1996, and _Panicum histii_ was not included as a candidate species under the updated categorization [61 FR 7596; February 28, 1996]. The revised categories further defined a candidate species as a species for which we have on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threats to support preparation of a listing proposal, but for which development of a listing regulation is precluded by other higher-priority listing activities.

In 1999, the Service included _Panicum histii_ as a new candidate species, using the updated definition, through its own internal assessment process (_i.e._, not via a petition), and assigned it an LPN of 5, meaning it was a species with a high magnitude of nonimminment threats (64 FR 57534, October 25, 1999). _Panicum histii_ was included in the subsequent annual CNRs with an LPN of 5 in 2001, 2002, and 2004 (66 FR 54808, October 30, 2001; 67 FR 40657, June 13, 2002; 69 FR 24876, May 4, 2004). The Service did not publish a CNOR in 2003.

On May 11, 2004, we received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity and other groups and individuals requesting that the Service list _Panicum histii_ and 225 other candidate species as endangered species or threatened species under the Act. In 2005, the Service again made a warranted-but-preched finding for the plant, with an LPN of 5, but noted a change in its scientific name to _Dichanthelium hitstii_ (70 FR 24870, May 11, 2005). In 2006 through 2014, _D. histii_ remained a candidate with an LPN of 5 (see September 12, 2006 (71 FR 53756), December 6, 2007 (72 FR 69034), December 10, 2008 (73 FR 75176), November 9, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 99222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66370), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69994), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), and December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450)). In 2015, _D. histii_ was included as a candidate in the CNOR, but the LPN of 5, but not included as a candidate species. While the 2015 published and draft documents of McAvoy _et al._ and Weakley, respectively, and the ITIS database information are more recent than the 2003 FNA's published treatment, those documents and database do not individually or collectively represent a more comprehensive systematic analysis of the plant's taxonomic status because they are not full taxonomic treatments of _Panicum_ and _Dichanthelium_. Therefore, the Service considers the FNA's 2003 treatment of _Panicum_ and _Dichanthelium_ as representing the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the plant's taxonomic status. The FNA's treatment indicates that neither _P. histii_ nor _D. histii_ is considered a species, subspecies, or variety. Therefore, the best available scientific and commercial information indicates that _P. histii_/_D. histii_ does not meet the Act's definition of a species.

_Finding_

Based on the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that _Dichanthelium hirstii_ does not meet the Act's definition of "species" and is, therefore, not a listable entity under the Act. _Dichanthelium hirstii_ was subsumed into _D. dichotomum_ ssp. _roanokense_ (Ashe), which "grows on the coastal plain from Delaware to southeast Texas and in the West Indies." As a result, we are removing _Dichanthelium hirstii_ from the candidate list.

As a result of the Service's 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month s synonym of _D. dichotomum_ ssp.

_Panicum histii_ is a candidate species in the Service's 2011 (catalog (70 FR 24870, May 11, 2005), and _Panicum_). This indicates that the plant the Service had considered a candidate species is not a valid taxon and is a component of a larger, more widespread species that appears to grow on the coastal plain from Delaware to southeastern Texas and in the West Indies. Although the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS; _[http://www.itis.gov/_](http://www.itis.gov/_)) reports that _Dichanthelium hirstii_ is an accepted species and the Service often relies on ITIS as a reliable database source of taxonomic information, in this instance ITIS is incorrect. Given this closer review of the taxonomic history of _P. histii_/_D. histii_, the Service recognizes that we overlooked the significance of the synonym information, and in retrospect should not have included _P. histii_ or _D. histii_ as a candidate species. While the 2015 published and draft documents of McAvoy _et al._ and Weakley, respectively, and the ITIS database information are more recent than the 2003 FNA's published treatment, those documents and database do not individually or collectively represent a more comprehensive systematic analysis of the plant's taxonomic status because they are not full taxonomic treatments of _Panicum_ and _Dichanthelium_.

This Indonesian dataset specifies the requirements of that settlement agreement for the First Brothers' panic grass, and constitutes the Service's 12-month finding on the May 4, 2004, petition to list the Hirst Brothers' panic grass as an endangered or threatened species. A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding, including a complete review of the taxonomic history, can be found in the first Brothers' panic grass's species-specific assessment form and other supporting documents (see _ADDRESSES_, above).
