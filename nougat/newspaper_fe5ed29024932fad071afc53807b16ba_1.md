The Committee's meetings were widely publicized throughout the sweet onion industry and all interested persons were invited to attend the meetings and participate in Committee deliberations on all issues. Like all Committee meetings, the December 8, 2003, and the February 10, 2004. meetings were public meetings and all entities, both large and small, were able to express their views.

An interim final rule concerning this action was published in the **Federal Register** on April 26, 2004 (69 FR 22377). Copies of the rule were mailed by the Committee's staff to all Committee members and Walla Walla sweet onion handlers. In addition, the rule was made available through the Internet by the Office of the Federal Register and the USDA. That rule provides a 60-day comment period which ended June 25, 2004. No comments were received.

Any questions about the compliance guide should be sent to lay Superheroid at the previously mentioned address in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the **Federal Register** (69 FR 22377, April 26, 2004) will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

both as amended, regulating the handling of raisins produced from graders in California, hereinafter referred to as the "order." The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (I U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the "Act."

USDA is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.

This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. Under the order provisions now in effect, final free and reserve percentages may be established for raisins acquired by handlers during the crop year. This rule continues to establish final free and reserve percentages for NS raisins for the 2003-04 crop year, which began August 1, 2003, and ends July 31, 2004. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations; or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with USDA a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing USDA would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review USDA's ruling on the petition, provided an action is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

This rule continues in effect final volume regulation percentages for 2003-04 crop NS raisins covered under the order. The volume regulation percentages are 70 percent free and 30 percent reserve, and were established through an interim final rule published on April 22, 2004 (69 FR 21695). Free tonnage raisins may be sold by handlers to any market. Reserve raisins must be held in a pool for the account of the Committee and are disposed of through various programs authorized under the order. For example, reserve raisins may be sold by the Committee to handlers for free use or to replace part of the free tonnage raisins they exported; used in diversion programs; carried over as a hedge against a short crop; or disposed of in other outlets not competitive with
