2. **(18%) On FA and Regular Languages** Say whether each of the following languages is regular or not regular? Prove your answers. 1. \(L_{1}=\{w|w\in\{0,1\}^{*}\) and \(w\) has an equal number of 0s and 1s\(\}\). 2. \(L_{2}=\{w|w\in\{0,1\}^{*}\) and \(w\) has an equal number of 01s and 10s\(\}\).
3. **(20%) On PDA and Context-Free Languages** Let \(L_{3}=\{wca^{m}b^{n}|w\in\{a,b\}^{*},\text{ where }w=w^{R},\text{ and }m,n\in\mathbb{N},n\leq m\leq 2n\}\). 1. 2. Give a context-free grammar for the language \(L_{3}\). 2. Design a PDA \(M=(K,\Sigma,\Gamma,\Delta,s,F)\) accepting the language \(L_{3}\). **Solution:** (a)

(b) The PDA \(M=(K,\Sigma,\Gamma,\Delta,s,F)\) is defined below:
