Figure 30.44Production of ahologram.Single-wavelength coherent light from a laser produces a well-defined interference pattern on a piece of film. The laser beam is split by a partially silvered miror,with part of the light illuminating the object and the remainder shining directly on the film.  

Light falling on a hologram can form a three-dimensional image.The process is complicated in detail,but thebasics can be understood as shown inFigure 30.45,in which a laser of the same type that exposed the film is now used to illuminate it.The myriad tiny exposed regions of the film are dark and block the light,while less exposed regions allow light to pass. The film thus acts much like a collection of diffraction gratings with various spacings. Light passing through the hologram is diffracted in various directions, producing both real and virtual images of the object used to expose the film.The interference pattern is the same as that produced by the object.Moving your eye to various places in the interference pattern gives you different perspectives,just as looking directly at the object would. The image thus looks like the object and is three-dimensional like the object.

Thehologram illustrated inFigure30.45isa transmissionhologram.Hologramsthat areviewedwithreflected light,suchasthe white lightholograms oncredit cards,arereflectionholograms andaremore common.White lighthologramsoften appeara little blurry with rainbow edges,because the difraction patterns of various colors of light are at slightly different locations due to their different wavelengths.Further uses of holography include all types of 3-D information storage, such as of statues in museums and engineering studiesof structures and3-D imagesof humanorgans. Invented in the late1940sbyDennisGabor (1900-1970), who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work, holography became far more practical with the development of the laser. Since lasers produce coherent single-wavelength light,their interference paterns are more pronounced.The precision is so great that it is even possible to record numerous holograms on a single piece of film by just changing the angle of the film for each successive image. This is how the holograms that move as you walk by them are producedâ€”a kind of lensless movie.
