# Beyond the Fields  

Thezombieshaveblazed a trail of sorts that allowsrelatively easy travel through the cornfield to O.S.C.A.R's bunker. O.S.C.A.R.has already started toprocess anotherincantation as the heroes approach. Read or paraphrase the following aloud.  

The slimy trail snakes a rambling route through the tall corn, illuminated by an occasional flash of lightning. After a few hundred yards,the corn abruptly parts to reveal a squatconcretebuildingsimilar to anelectrical utilityshed.Powerlinesfrom thenearby towersstretch to connectwith it.  

About two dozen yards from the bunker, two humanoid creatures apparently made of metal are standing beside a metallic utility box of some sort.They appeartoberepairingsomething inside.  

Suddenly,the dull roar of the thunder isoverlaidwith an angry buzzing sound,as though someone has dis turbed ahornet'snest.  

The buzzing sound is a magical side effect of demolish,the next incantation that O.S.C.A.R. is preparing.(This incantation was createdwithSeed:Destroy.See Chapter3:Spells in the URBAN ARCANA CampaignSetting and the New Incantations sectionattheendofthisadventure.)Thesound,whileloud, has no effect other than to annoy those who hear it.  

Creatures:Next to thebunker,two of O.S.C.A.R.s minion robots areworking inside a metal utility box.Any character whomakes a successful DC10 Knowledge (technology) check recognizes it as a utility box for high-speed internet connections.The robots are attempting to restore O.S.C.A.R's T3 connectiontotheoutsideworld.  

Minion Robots (2):hp 21, 21.See the newmonster descriptionattheendofthis adventurefordetails
