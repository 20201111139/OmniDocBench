straight to themanufacturer'swebsite can saveyou lots of time.Most componentshave a datecodewhich used tobeyear andweek(like 8634)but these days they canbe crypticbatch codes.(In the old days, a TTL74-series logicICmadein1974,with a74xxdatecode(Figure 2) couldbeapuzzler!)  

If you have a fewcomponentsofone type,lookforacodethat's the sameonallof them—thatwillbethepart number,theothercodes willbedate-orbatchcodesofnointerest.  

Values on passive components are either shown directly (like 47pF) orasfiguresorresistorcolourcodeintheformDigit,Digit2,Multiplier (being the numberofzeros)on the component. SoSMD inductors oftenhavethevaluemarkedinmicrohenriesinthisfashion,so3R3is  $3.3\,\mu{\mathsf{H}}$  and333is  $33\mid77\ H$   $33,000\ \mu(1)$  .Capacitorsmaybemarked in picofarads.Atantalumcapacitorlabelled227is  $22\times10^{7}\,\mathsf{p F}=220\,\mathsf{\mu F}.$  Somecomponentsmayhavefiveorsixringsof colourcode,butthe Internet is a great help in decoding these.  

Mostsmall SMDcapacitorsarenotmarked atall,souseyourcomponent test skills and equipment toverify them.And get a magnifying glassoraUSBmicroscope(whichiswhatIusedtotakemostofthe photos for this article)- it makes it much easier to see the tiny writing onsmallcomponents.  

The internet hasmany resources to assist you- search for"IC Manufacturers logos"or"SMDcodes"if you need more information.And look up"EIA $96^{\prime\prime}$  todecodeSMDresistorswithwhatlookslikeaweird 2-numberplus1-lettercode.  

# Consider the Context  

If you'restrippingpartsoffboards,orotherwiseknowwhere thecomponent came from,that may giveyou a clue as to what thepart is.A powersupplyislikelytohaveaswitched-modePWM IC,whereasan audioboard ismore likelytohaveop-amps.  

# Don'tExpect to Identify Everything!  

I havea bag of transistors labelled ov8Fwhich have stubbornly refused tobeidentified.SMD components canbe difficult orimpossible to identify,as they oftenhave shortenedpart numbers on them.Even with the considerable resources on the internet, they are not easy.  

# BeSelective  

I mentioned theboards I got as akid,withbent-over component leads. Ireligiouslyunsoldered allof them.Thesedays I won'ttouchsuch componentsunless they arereallyspecial;it's notworththeeffort.  

Electrolyticcapacitorsshould alwaysbetested,especiallylargepower supply types,and look for domes on the tops —a dead giveaway that they havegonedryor leaky.  

Older components such as carbonresistors are really not worth keeping,andolderelectrolyticcapacitorswill oftenbemuch larger, for their ratings, thanmodern types.  

Many modern SMDICs have very fine pitch leads or are ball-grid array (BGA)typeswhich need specialized equipment to installand remove on boards. Soif it's not something you can see a use for,junk it.  

If youthink itmightbesomethingyoucanuse,identifyit tobesure beforeyou go to the troubleof unsoldering it.  

Being able to identify and use componentsfromold boards can well repaythetimeyouspend doingit.Youcangethigh-qualitycompo nents and if you store them systematically, you can often avoid having tobuypartsfora project.In addition,youcan oftenusetheseskills when attemptingrepairs on circuit boards.
