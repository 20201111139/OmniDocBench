# SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  

# L. Abstract  

Form BE140, Benchmark Survey of Insurance Transactions by U.S. Insurance Companies with Foreign Persons, obtains annual data from all U.S. insuranoe companies that engage in the following international insurance transactions: [1) Premiums earned on reinsuranoe assumed from insurance companies resident abroad; (2) losses incurred on reinsurance assumed from insurance companies resident abroad; (3] premiums earned on primary insurance sold to foreign persons; (4] losses incurred on primary insurance sold to foreign persons; (5) premiums incurred on reinsurance ceded to  

insurance companies resident abroad: [6] losses recovered on reinsurance ceded to insurance companies resident abroad; (7) receipts for auxiliary insurance services; and (8] payments for auxiliary insurance services. In addition, insurance companies with transactions in at least one of the eight categories listed above that exceed \$2 million must supply country specific data on the amount of their insurance transactions for each calegorv.  

The data are needed to monitor U.S. international trade in insurance services, anallyze its impact on the U.S. economy and foreign economies, compile and improve the U.S. economic accounts, support U.S. commercial policy on insurance services, conduct trade promotion, and improve the ability of U.S. businesses to identify and evaluate market opportunities.  

This survey is conducted al five year intervals; it was last conducted for 2008 and will be conducted again for 2013. The 2013 survey will be sent to respondents on March 30, 2014 and reports are due by June 30, 2014.  

Two changes are proposed to the 2013 BE140 form: (1) drop questions on finite reinsurance because finite reinsurance is a dated concept that is no longer relevant, and (2) add questions to identify the transaction code, size, type and nature of large and irregular transactions, defined as those contracls with premiums ceded or assumed in excess of S1 billion and thal are al least three times the size of a reporter's average regular contract. The new information will allow BEA to measure more accurately insurance services on an accrual basis and to exclude transactions that are not related to insurance services.  

# IL. Method of Collection  

The surveys are sent to the respondents by U.S. mail and are also available from the BEA Web site. Respondents may return the surveys one of four ways: U.S. mail, electronically using BEA's electronic collection system [eFile], fax, or email.
