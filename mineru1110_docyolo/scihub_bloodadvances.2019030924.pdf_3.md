weobserved significantlyelevatedSiRs among gastricMZL survivors(SIR,6.70;  $95\%$  Cl, 4.34-9.90) but not among nongastric extranodal MZL survivors(SIR,1.67;  $95\%$  Cl,0.80-3.06; Pheterogeneity  $<$  .01; Figure 1) or nodal MZL survivors (data not  shown;SIR,1.48; $95\%$ Cl,0.68-2.81).ThisriskaftergastricMZLwas similar across treatments(data not shown;SIRrange,5.98- 9.15).Likewise,the SIR for stomach cancer was significantly increased aftergastricDLBCL(SIR,2.67;  $95\%$  CI,1.07-5.50) but notafternongastricextranodalDLBCL(SIR,1.32;  $95\%$  CI, 0.77- 2.11), although the SIRs did not differ significantly (Pheterogeneity  $=$  .12).Additionally,theSiRforstomachcancerwaselevatedamong survivorsofnodalDLBCL(SIR,1.50; $95\%$ CI,1.06-2.05).In sec-ondaryanalysesstratifyingDLBCLsurvivorsbyHIV/AIDSstatusat the time of diagnosis, the risk of anal cancer was much more strongly elevatedamongthosewithknownHIV/AIDS(SIR,68.34;  $95\%$  CI, 37.36-114.66)thanthosewithoutknownHIV/AIDS(SIR,2.09;  $95\%$  Cl,1.22-3.34;Table3)  

Additional analysesof the mostcommonlyoccurring second cancers (liver and stomach cancers) evaluated SiRpatterns by patient subgroup(Tables 4 and 5).In general, SIRs were largely consistent acrossageatfirstprimary NHL diagnosis,sex,time since first primary NHL diagnosis, stage of first primary NHL, and initial treatmentof firstprimaryNHL,but therewereafew exceptions.For stomach cancer(Table 4),theonlyindication of borderline heterogeneitywas by stage forMZL survivors(early stage: SIR,  $3.79$  ;advanced stage: SIR, 2.00; Pheterogeneity  $=$  .07);notably,a majority of early-stage MZL cases  $n=21$  of 31) were gastric MZL. For liver cancer (Table 5), the SIR among DLBCLsurvivorsdiagnosedbeforeage 60yearswashigher than thatamongpatientsdiagnosedwithDLBCL atolderages (SIR, 2.89 vs 1.21; Pheterogeneity   $<.01$  )and during the first 5yearsafterDLBCLcomparedwithlaterperiods(SIR,2.23vs 1.32;  $P_{h}$  eterogeneity  $<.01)$  .Liver cancer SIRs after DLBCL and MZLwere significantly elevated onlyamongmales,butdifferences by sexwerenot statistically significant(DLBCL:SIR,1.96vs 1.48; Pheterogeneity  $>$  .50; MZL: SIR, 2.32 vs 1.14; Pheterogeneity  $=$  .16). Additionally, although there was no overall increase in liver cancer afterFL,the SIRwassignificantlyelevated highest among FL survivorswhoreceived initial chemotherapy andradiotherapy (SIR, 2.53; Pheterogeneity  $=$  .02), based on 7 observed cases. Across NHL subtypes,there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the SIRsforstomachorlivercancersbycalendaryearperiodof NHL diagnosis(datanotshown).
