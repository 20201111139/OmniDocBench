# Automation technologies can bebroadly grouped into three categories:  

1.Robotic Process Automation (RPA): Thesimplestformofautomation, RPA technologyautomatesrepetitive rule-based processes.This technology cannot learn,adaptormake decisions; anRPAbotsimplyappliesa consistent setofrulestoaprocesstodeliverquick and efficientoutcomes.Many manual administrativeprocessescanbe streamlined in this way.  

2.Machinelearning:Atthenextlevelis machine learning, where a computer is able touse largevolumes of data tounderstandandpredictthedesired courseofaction,withperformance improving overtime.Chat-botsare agoodexampleof machinelearning being used today in the financial sector. These bots use technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) tocommunicateinrealtimewith human customers,use datafrompast interactions to understand the nature of the customer's query,and provide the desired informationorresponse.  

3.Cognitive augmentation: Cognitive augmentationistheclosestwe currentlyhavetotrueartificial intelligence.Cognitivecomputers,such asIBM'sWatson,areabletohandle unstructured data andprovide answers tocomplexqueries,enabling them to completetasksthatcouldonceonlybe performedby humans.
