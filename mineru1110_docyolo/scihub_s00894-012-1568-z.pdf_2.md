performed the totalenergyof thesephases as afunction of volume and theirenergy-volume relationswerefit to the thirdorder Birch Murnaghan equation of states. The energyvolume curve of the structures is presented in Fig. 2 and as shown ZB structure has the lowest energy. On the other hand, to determine themost stable structure at finite pressure and temperature,thefree energy  $\mathrm{G{=}E_{t o t}{+}P V{-}T S}$  shouldbeused. Ourdensityfunctional calculations arebasically completed at zeroKelvin temperature and entropic contributions can be ignored. Therefore, the enthalpy values,  $\mathrm{H=E+pV,}$  including the pressure-volume effects are determined.Thisbehavioris compatiblewith aphasetransitionbetween thesestructures, which is also clearly reflected in the enthalpy calculation.  

Simplecomparisonof thestaticlattice enthalpiesofZB state,  $1\overline{4}\Pi^{2}$  (binary  $\beta.$  -tin)and theImm2state determinesthe pressure of the transition between them.The crossingof three enthalpy curves indicates a pressure-induced phase transition between these phases.The computed enthalpy curves of the ZB,  $[\overline{{4}}\Pi]$  and Imm2phases areplotted as a function of pressure in Fig. 3.As can be seen from the figure,the enthalpy curves of the  $[4\pi2$  phaseand Imm2 phasehave thesame enthalpyand intersectwith that of ZB phaseat  $4.8\ \mathrm{GPa}$  indicating a first orderphasetransition between these phases. On the other hand, from the energyvolume data,we alsocalculate thebulkmodulus ofthese phases.For the zinc-blende state,our bulk modulus is  $53.2\;\mathrm{GPa}$  whichisrelativelyclosetothetheoreticalvalues  $46\;\mathrm{GPa}$  and 48.98 GPa[18,19]. The bulk modulus can vary in a wide range according to the methodology of the study. The bulk modulus of the  $[\overline{{4}}\Pi]$  (binary  $\beta^{\cdot}$  tin)phase is calculated tobe  $70.7\ \mathrm{GPa}$  and thebulkmodulus of the Imm2phaseiscalculated tobe  $75.7\ \mathrm{GPa}$  In general,our results agree with the experimental and theoretical results.

Thepressure-volumerelation of CdTeobtained throughthe constant pressure simulation can be seen in Fig.4.As can be seen from the figure,the volume monotonically decreases with increasing pressure to  $15\ \mathrm{GPa}$  When the pressure is increased from 15to  $20\ \mathrm{GPa}$  the structural phase transition begins and volume shows a noticeable decrease, which is typical for a first order phase transition.The structural analysis brings out that zinc-blende CdTe converts into a  $[\overline{{4}}\mathfrak{m}]$  (binary  $\beta$  tin) structure. This tendency is indeed anticipated when some conditions in simulations are considered,namely,the use ofideal structure,the size of thesimulated structure etc. Consequently, simulated systems have to cross a significant energy barrier to transform from one phase to another.  

In this study,we are particularly interested in understanding the transformationmechanism to controlstructural phase transition.Therefore, as a next step,we studied the atomicmovementduring thephase transformationby
