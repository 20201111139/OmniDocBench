SummaryEpidemiological studies have suggested that many  $r\sqcap r\sqcap e$  diseaseswithrespiratory involvement have a genetic component. Molecular advances have increased the understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases which has led to better diagnostic and prognostic methods. There may be many genes responsible for diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to the effect of modifier genes. The genotype:phenotype correlation in these diseases remains to be elucidated.In some diseases,such as familial dysautonomia and sickle cell,the gene has been identified which allows for accurate pre-natal testing. Further, in diseases where the genetic abnormality is known, such as chronic granulomatous disease, gene therapy remains a realisticprospect and phase I studies are about to commence or currently underway. This article reviews those rare diseases in which there is or is likely to be a significantgeneticcontribution.  $\textcircled{1}200$  IHarcourtPublishersLtd

# THEGENETICPOTENTIAL  

Overthepastfewyearstherehavebeengreatadvances in molecular technology.Thishasenabledfurther understanding of themolecular pathophysiology and causation ofmanydiseases and theinteractionbetween thehost and the environment that influences expression(Fig.I). In those diseases inwhich the environmentcannotbe manipulated,theultimatehopeistoidentifyandcorrect themoleculardefectsormanipulatethemin an attempt to overcome the abnormalities they cause.This article examines the geneticcontribution inrarediseases that havepulmonaryinvolvement and inwhichthere hasbeen asignificantgeneticcontribution with the potential for futuregenetherapy.  

The identification ofgene defectswill lead to agreater understandingof the pathophysiology of disease,should increase diagnostic sensitivity and,by understanding genotype:phenotype correlation,lead to more accurate prognosis.In many diseases,it is likely that there is a genetic influence from modifier genes and understanding more aboutthesegenesoffers thepromiseoftherapeuticadvances.Molecular techniques also help to identify other potential factorswhich may be implicated in diseases thoughtpreviouslynot tohave a geneticpredisposition. One such example is respiratory syncitial virusmediated disease in which a polymorphism of the host interleukin (IL) 8 promoter region has been related to disease severity.Someknown genetic contributions to lungdisease and its expression aresummarisedinTableI.  

Current attempts at therapeutic measures include overcoming the abnormalities caused by thegene or introducinga functioninggene throughgene therapy.Cystic fibrosis(CF) is the paradigm for gene therapy in respiratory disease.Since the gene was localised more than 100 patientshavereceived the gene in CF clinical trials.
