contentsof Mn and Si,whichis consistentwith the literature.li6.3o]After being SHTed for 8hours,almost the entire amount of  $\mathrm{Al}_{2}\mathrm{Cu}$  is dissolved into the Al matrix as shown in Figure 2(b). It is also interesting to note that the Chinese script  $x_{1}$  Fephasebecomes unstableandistransformedintoasmallamountof short intermetallic platelets,leading to the fragmentation of the  $x=$  Fe.  

The chemical compositions of the iron-rich intermetallicsinAlloyBin the as-cast andSHTed (for 8hours) conditionsmeasuredbySEM-EDsareshownin TableII.It can be found thathigher Al contents are detected in the  $x$  FeandSTed  $\beta$  -FeafterSHT than the corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from theliquid.This canbeattributed to thepartial contributionof thesurroundingAlmatrixduetothesmall sizesofthefragmented  $x$  FeandSTed  $\beta$  Feparticles afterSHT.Comparedwith the as-castcondition,it can be found that the iron content in  $x$  -Feisreduced after SHT for 8hours.As shown inFigure 2(),however,the EBsDresultswith amean angular deviation (MAD)of 0.452,lower than 0.7whichis considered tobecritical for an accurate solution,3ll indicate that this phase is still the  $\mathcal{U}$  Fe(body-centered cubicwith  $a,~b$  ,and  $c$  as  $1.265~\mathrm{nm}^{[11]}$  .Moreover, the platelet-like intermetallic phase formed during theSHThasa similar chemical composition to the  $\beta$  -Fe obtained in the as-cast condition (Table II) and thus is termed as solid-state-transformed  $\beta$  -Fe(STed  $\beta^{\cdot}$  Fe)to distinguish it from the  $\beta$  -Fe directly precipitated from liquid metal during solidification.Theformationof theSTed  $\beta$  Feisfurther confirmedalowMADvalueof0.258asmeasuredby EBSD (Figure 2(d)), The STed  $\beta$  Fe ismost likely to have the same crystal structure as the solidified  $\beta$  -Fe (tetragonal withaandbof  $0.634\mathrm{~nm}$  andcof  $\mathrm{\dot{l}.488\ n m^{[11]}}\mathrm{\Omega}$  due to their similar diffraction patterns. However,theSTed  $\beta$  Fehaslower  $\mathrm{Cu}$  content than the  $\beta$  Fe(Table  $\mathrm{II}$  ),and the replacement of the  $\mathrm{Cu}$  by Al
