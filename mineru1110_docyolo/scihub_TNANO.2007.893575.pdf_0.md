# I.INTRODUCTION  

O OVERCOME the scalability issues and process complexity of 1-transistor/l-capacitor DRAM cell, capacitorless 1-transistor (1T)DRAM cells have been recently proposed and investigated[1].The mainstream 1T DRAM cell is a floating body transistor cell (FBC)which consists of a MOSFET with its body floating electrically. The FBC is realized by a MOSFET formed on partially depleted siliconon-insulator (PD-SOI).When excess holes exist in the floating body, the cell state can be defined as “1”(decreased  $V_{\mathrm{th}}$  0.On the other hand,when excess holes are swept out of thefloating body through forward bias on the body-drain junction, the cell state can be defined as‘  $"$  (increased  $V_{\mathrm{th}}$  .Bymeasuring the draincurrentdifferencebetween"i"and  $"0"$  states of the cell, we can sensewhether theholes are accumulated in thefloating body.Because the floatingbodyis used as the storagenode,the FBC has no complicated storage capacitor. Therefore, the FBC has a simple process and can have a cell area below  $\mathrm{4F^{2}}$  [2], [3]  

In thiswork,wepropose asurroundinggateMOsFET with verticalchannel(SGVCcell)asa1T DRAMcell.Unlikeother 1T DRAM cells which are integrated on SOI substrates,the SGVCcellcanbemorecosteffectivesinceit canbefabricated onbulkSi substrates.Also,thereisnoneedforthesourcecontact andline duetothe commonsourcestructure,whichmakes  $\mathrm{4F^{2}}$  structure possible and ultimately leads to superior scalability. Thememory operationhasbeeninvestigated by simulation.Also,we have successfully fabricated a highly scalable SGVC cell and thememoryeffect ismeasured forthefirst time.

# II.SIMULATION RESULTS  

Fig.1 schematically shows the operationprinciple of an SGVC cell [4]. It can be noted that it has a floating body where holes are accumulated for memory effects. To verify memory cell operation,2-D device simulationwasperformed.Weused ATLAS as a simulator. Excess holes are generated by impact ionization in this simulation.Simulatedparameters arelisted in Table I. The difference in the body potential of each state and the  $I_{D}-V_{G}$  characteristicswereextractedfirst,in ordertoshow the accumulation of holes in the body of the SGVC cell. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of theholepotential between  $"1"$  state and reference state (  $V_{\mathrm{gate}}\,=\,0$   $V_{\mathrm{source}}=0$  ，  $V_{\mathrm{drain}}=0)$  . In the case of state “1”' through impact ionization in the high field region near the drain, excess holes are injected into the body and then thebodypotentialincreases.Fig.3 shows  $I_{d}-V_{g}$  characteristics of the SGVC cell.The drain current of“1” stateislarger than that of  $"0"$  state.This is due to the increase of thebodypotential whenholesareaccumulatedinto the body through writing operation,hence lowering the threshold voltage, which in turn increases the drain current. Subsequently, thedraincurrentasafunctionoftimewasextracted toshow
