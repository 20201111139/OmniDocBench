# Bioassays  

The T.confusum larvae used in the studywere from a pesticidesusceptiblestrainmaintained at theUnited StatesDepartmentof Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service-Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (USDA-ARS-CGAHR,Manhattan,KS). Triboliumconfusum colonies arereared on  $95\,\%$  organicwholewheatflourand  $5\,\%$  brewer'syeastat  $27^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$   $60\,\%$  RH,and0:24 (L:D)h in an environmentalchamber. These colonies have been maintained at theUSDA-ARS-CGAHRformore than30 yr.  

Testingarenasused in this study wereindividual  $60\,\times\,15\,\mathrm{\mm}$   $(-22c m^{2})$  Petri dishespartiallyfilled with concrete andplaced insidelarger  $150\times20~\mathrm{mm}$   $/{\sim}137~\mathrm{cm^{2}})$  plastic Petri dishes. Concrete dishes were prepared based on Arthur (2015).Briefly,a dry powder driveway patching material (Rockite,Hartline Product Co.,Inc., Cleveland,OH)wasmixedwithwater to create a thin slurry,poured in thebottomofPetridishesto adepthof  ${\sim}0.5~\mathrm{cm}$  andheldatambient conditionsfor approximately  $7+1$  Inside each Petri dish,four concrete arenas were placed. Three of the arenas were used in the current studyforresidualbioassays at2,4,and6wkpost-aerosol treatment andcontainednodietattime ofexposureto aerosol.The other arena was used as described by Scheff et al. (2018).  

These groups of testing arenas were placed at ten different positions on the third floor (Fig. 1). Nine positions also had aerodynamic particle sizer units (APS 3321,TSIInc.,Shoreview,MN) placed to collect data on aerosolparticleconcentration andsize distribution.  

Two additional testing arenas were placed on thefirst floor of the mill during each aerosol treatment and served as untreated controls. Arenas were placed in each of the four major corners of the mill floor (arenas 4,5,8,10).Bioassay arenas along walls were placed approximately  $0.5\;\mathrm{m}$  away from thewall(arenas 4,5,6,8,9,10). Bioassay arena 2was placed in between two large pieces of milling equipment and pneumatic conveying ducts.Bioassay arena 7was placed underneath a piece of milling equipment. Relative to the applicationlocations,bioassay arena 1wasplaced directlyinfront of aerosolapplicationlocation1andbioassayarenas9and4were placed next to aerosol application locations 2 and3,respectively.  

After aerosol applications,each bioassay arena was covered and transported backto theUSDA-ARS-CGAHRand held at  $27^{\circ}C$   $60\%$  RH,and 0:24(L:D) in an environmental chamber.At 2,4,and 6wk post-aerosol application,five(3-4wk old) T.confusumlarvae along with  ${\sim}400~\mathrm{mg}$  ofdietwere added to one concrete arena from each bioassay arena position.Number of larvae available for bioassays was limited,but five larvae per dish does provide sufficient resolution to evaluateIGR effectson development.Larvae were examined twiceweekly,upto4wk,for adult emergence.Emerged adults wereremovedfrom dishes toprevent cannibalism.  

At the end of 4wk, all five individuals were classified as larvae, pupae,or adults.Means and SEswere calculated for adult emergence and data analyzed using statistical analysis software (version 9.4, SASInstitute,Cary,NC).Adult emergence data were transformed to angular values prior to analysis(Zar2010)beforeusinga three-way analysisofvariancebased onbioassayposition,applicationposition, andresidual week asthemain effects.  

# AerosolDispersalPatterns  

To assess the strength of the effect of the aerosol application, an efficacyvalue index was created to convert the three morpho logical states (larvae,pupae,adult) to a single value for comparison (Campbell et al. 2014). The efficacy index ranged from 1,the weakest efficacy response with five adults,to21,the strongestresponse with five larvae.All of the indexvalues with the correspondingnumbers of adults,pupae,and larvae indicated in bracketswere thefollowing: 1[5,0,0],2[4,1,0],3[4,0,1],4[3,2,0],5[3,1,1],6[3,0,2],7[2,3,0], 8[2,2,1],9[2,1,2],10[2,0,3],11[1,4,0],12[1,3,1],13[1,2,2],14 [1,1,3],15[1,0,4],16[0,5,0],17[0,4,1],18[0,3,2],19[0,2,3],20 [0,1,4],21[0,0,5].
