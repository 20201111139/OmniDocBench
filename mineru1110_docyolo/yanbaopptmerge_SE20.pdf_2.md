Assume that an error uncovered during design will cost 1.5 monetary unit to correct. Relative to this cost, the same error uncovered just before testing commences will cost 6.5 units; during testing, 15 units; and after release, between 67 and 100 units.  

A number of studies indicate that design activities introduce between 50% - 65% of all errors during the software process. However, formal review technique have been shown to be up to 75% effective in uncovering design flaws.
