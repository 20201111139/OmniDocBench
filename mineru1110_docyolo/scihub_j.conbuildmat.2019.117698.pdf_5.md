# 2.3.4.Environmental scanning electron microscope(ESEM)  

ESEM（Quanta FEG250,FEI,Hillsboro OR,USA)was used to observe themorphology andmicrostructureof theNT@RCBs.Different from traditional scanning electron microscopy,ESEM requires no pre-treatment such as drying, conduction, or dehydration.Hence,the samples were directly placed under the lens to obtain the micrographs.Themicro-spectroscopy elementswere analysed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy(EDs,Oxford Instruments7274).

# 3.1.Characterization of CPs  

Fig.7(theupper subgraph)presents themicrographof  $N T@R C$  EDSperformedatpoint44revealsthatthematerialloadedonto the surface of RG is NT. In comparison, point 46 held almost no Ti.That is,the soakingmethod ensures only somepartsof the surface of RG are covered byNTwhile some other parts arenot.It is crucial because photorefraction is provided by transparent areas that should not be covered byNT.Onthecontrary,Fig.7(thelower subgraph)exhibits themicrographofNT@RCBSandconfirmsthat NT isloaded ontopartof thesurfaceandfilled intosomepores of RCBSduring thepreparation of the CPs. This statement contains two sections.First,some NTis loaded ontopart of the surface of RCBS.Itisprovedby theESEMpictures alongwith theEDS(see Fig.7).Since the spectrumat bothpoints54and55displayhigh proportions of Ti that is not held by RCBS itself (see Table 1). In particular, during the soaking,theRCBswas fully immersed into the NT solution.That is to say,NT particles surrounded the RCBS and had the equal chance to load onto any part of RCBs because no particularpart ofRCBswasproved tohave thecapacityof selective adsorption.Furthermore,the ESEM and EDSwere picturedrandomly. To some degree,they at leastprove that the majority of RCBSsurfaceiscovered byNT.Second,RCBShasaporousstructure and extremely rough surface. Some NT particles are deposited and accumulated inside thepores aswellason the surface.This is proved by the porosity and pore size distribution analysis,with results in Fig. 8b. The porosities of RCBS and  ${\mathrm{NT@RCBS}}$  are29 and  $26.5\%$  respectively.Thereduced porosity of  ${\mathrm{NT@RCBS}}$  relative toRCBSis due tothefillingof NT after thesoaking.The absolute reductionisonly  $2.5\%$  whichechoesthelimitedNTloadingamount measured by the analytical balance below.Furthermore,referring
