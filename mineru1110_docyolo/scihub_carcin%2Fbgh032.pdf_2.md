# NF  $R\!\!\!\!/\,B$  reportersystem  

The ability ofDCA to activate NF $\mathrm{FEB}$  was investigated using a luciferase reporter system in which the luciferase gene was under the control of a NF $k\mathrm{B}$  dependent promoter (Stratagene, Cambridge,UK).In short,the OE33 cells wereseededintriplicateinto6well tissuecultureflasksandthe  $\mathrm{NF-FB}$  luciferase plasmidwas transfected into them using the genejammer transfection reagent (Stratagene).Initial experiments validated the transfection using a suppliedpositive control for  $\mathrm{NF-KB}$  activity.The cellswere then either exposed to DCA for varying periods of time  $(0-4\ h)$  or remained untreated. After exposure,the cells were processed following themanufacturer'srecommendations to release the luciferase enzyme and the subsequent luciferase expressionwasquantifiedwith the Bright-Gloluciferaseassaysystem (Promega,Southampton,UK).Resultingluminescence wasmeasured using a luminometer(AnthosLabtechInstruments,Salzburg,Austria).Fold increases were calculatedbased on thebackground luminescence of theuntreated cells (untreated cellswere set upfor each time point analysed).The  $t^{\star}$  -testwasused to evaluate differences between the triplicate readings from treated and untreatedcells.

RNAextractedfromuntreatedOE33cellsandOE33cells treated for  $24\;\mathrm{h}$  with  $300~\upmu\mathrm{M}$  DCA at  $\mathrm{pH}\nobreakspace7\nobreakspace$  ,was analysed usingfive different pathwayspecificmembranearrays.Byfar the most prominent of the DCA induced gene expression changeswere theswitchingonof  $\mathrm{I}\kappa\mathrm{B}$  and IL-8.AsIkB and IL-8 are transcriptional targets of NF $\mathsf{R B}$  ,this suggests activation of  $\mathrm{NF-KB}$  byDCA (asis demonstratedbelow).Asshown in Figure 2, using a cancer pathway array and a signal transduction array, both  $\mathrm{IkB}$  and IL-8 are substantially up-regulated  $24~\mathrm{h}$  afterDCAtreatment.Figure 2 also shows anumber of other changes in gene expression  $\boldsymbol{\tilde{2}4}\boldsymbol{\mathrm{~h~}}$  after DCA treatment (mostly up-regulation), these (and other changes noted from other arrays) are documented in TableI.  

The gene expression alterations listed in Table I from the five different arrays used,have been grouped into four separate groups based on the function of the genes involved. As IL-8 (29) and IkB(30)have previously been suggested to be transcriptional

This table contains a list of genes whose expression was consistently altered after exposure to DCA.By consistent,we mean that the expression change was evident on both duplicate array experiments (although no real-time PCR data available).In theright hand column is the time point at which the expression changewas evident.The arrows in the central column reflect therelative strength oftheexpressionchanges.

Fig. 2.Membrane array analysis of DCA treated OE33 cells,  $24\;\mathrm{h}$  post-exposure. (a) Cancer pathway arrays were used to study gene expression abnormalities inducedby  $300\ \upmu\mathrm{M}$  DCA relative to untreated OE33 cells.These example arrays show the up-regulation of the IkB and IL-8 genes by DCA. (b) Two example signal transduction arrays are shown; those hybridized with cDNA from untreated OE33 cells and cDNA from OE33 cells  $24\;\mathrm{h}$  after DCAexposure. A number of other genes are up-regulated by DCA,particularly evident in the cancer pathway array in (a). These genes (and others) are identified in Table I.
