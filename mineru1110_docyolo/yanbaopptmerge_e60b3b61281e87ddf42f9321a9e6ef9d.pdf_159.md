100. Calculate the mean, median, standard deviation, the first quartile,the third quartile and the IQR. Round toone decimal place.  

101. What additional information is needed to construct a box plot for the FTES for 2005-2006 through 2010-2011 and a box plot for the FTES for 1976-1977 through 2004-2005?  

102. Compare the IQR for the FTES for 1976-77 through 2004-2005 with the IQR for the FTES for 2005-2006 through   
2010-2011. Why do you suppose the IQRs are so different?

104. A music school has budgeted to purchase three musical instruments. They plan to purchase a piano costing  $S3,000$  ,a guitar costing  $S550$  , and a drum set costing  $9600$  The mean cost for a piano is  $\mathbb{S}4,000$  with a standard deviation of  $52,500$  Themean cost for a guitar is  $\mathbb{S}500$  with a standard deviation of  $9200$  The mean cost for drumsis  $9700$  with a standard deviation of  $\mathbb{S}100$  Whichcost is thelowest,whencompared tootherinstrumentsof thesametype?Whichcost is thehighest when compared to other instruments of the same type. Justify your answer.  

105. An elementary school class ran one mile with a mean of 11 minutes and a standard deviation of three minutes. Rachel, a student in the class, ran one mile in eight minutes. A junior high school class ran one mile with a mean of nine minutes and a standard deviation of two minutes. Kenji, a student in the class, ran 1 mile in 8.5 minutes. A high school class ran one mile with a mean of seven minutes and a standard deviation of four minutes. Nedda, a student in the class, ran one mile in eight minutes.  

a.Why is Kenji considered a better runner than Nedda, even though Nedda ran faster than he? b.Who is the fastest runner with respect to his or her class? Explain why.
