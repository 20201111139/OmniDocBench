Title VI is comprised of three parts; Part A provides nutrition and supportive services to American Indians and Alaska Natives, Part B provides nutrition and supportive  

services to Native Hawaiians, and Part C provides caregiver services to any programs that have Part A/B.  

The evalluation will consist of six dala collection activities: (1) Tribal program staff interviews; (2) tribal program staff focus groups, (3) tribal elder focus groups, (4) tribal elder interviews, (5) tribal caregiver focus groups, and (6) follow-up tribal program staff interview.  

ACL is requesting to revise the currently approved data collection under OMB 09850059 by removing the caregiver survey and adding a follow-up tribal program staff interview. The proposed revisions also include removing annual performance reporting data ellements from the currentily approved IC under OMB 09850059 to the OMB approved Title VI Annual Performance Report under OMB 0985 0007.
