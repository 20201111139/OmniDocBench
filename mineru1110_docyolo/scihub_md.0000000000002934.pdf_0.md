Abstract:This study aimed to evaluate cancerrisk and possible risk factors in patients diagnosed with empyema.  

A total of31,636patientswithnewly diagnosed empyema between January1,1999 and December 31,2010were included in this study. Standardized incidence ratios(SIRs) were calculated to compare the cancer incidence in these empyema patients to that in the general population.Adjusted hazardratioswere alsocalculated toinvestigate whether characteristicsincreased cancerrisk.  

During the12-year study period,2,654 cancersoccurred in31,636 patientswithempyema,yieldinganSIRof2.67  $95\%$  confidence interval[C1]2.57-2.78).Weexcludedcancer thatoccurredwithin1 year toavoid surveillancebias.Thecancerriskremained significantly increased (SIR 1.50,  $95\%$  CI 1.41-1.58).Specifically,patients with empyemahad higherSIRofcancersofthehead andneck(1.50,  $95\%$  CI 1.41-1.58),esophagus (2.56,  $95\%$  CI 1.92-3.33), stomach (1.49,  $95\%$  CI 1.16-1.89), liver and biliary tract (2.18,  $95\%$  CI 1.93-2.45),and lung and mediastinum (1.62,  $95\%$  CI 1.39-1.86).Age  $\geq60$  male sex, diabetesmellitus,and liver cirrhosiswereindependentriskfactors for cancerdevelopment.  

Our study demonstrates anincreased incidenceofcancer developmentinpatientswith empyema,andpatients'age  $>60$  men,andthose withdiabetesmellitus andlivercirrhosisshowedahigherincidence of developing cancer compared to the general population.The association between suchkindof infection and secondarymalignancymay be elucidatedbyfurther study.

# INTRODUCTION  

mpyemaisthe accumulation ofpusin thethoraciccage that often results from a progressive deposition of parapneumonic fluid. Persistent infection eventually results in the formation of scar tissue and a pleural peel encompassing the lung.Even with the advance of antibiotics and pneumococcal vaccines,this still accountsfor approximately  $5\%$  of cases ofpneumonia. Incidence of empyema has been increasingworldwide in recent decades.About  $15\%$  of empyema patients die and  $30\%$  of patients require interventional drainage of the pleural space.4.5 Most studies focus on short-term empyema complications; however,the long-term effects of this disease,including cancer, havehardlybeen studied.  

Increased cancerriskinpatients with inflammatory and infectious diseases has been reported in many studies.67 Furthermore,the effects of chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease on cancer have been well documented.89 However, no study todate hasfocused on the association between empyema and further cancerrisk.  

Using the National HealthInsurance Research Dataset (NHIRD)of Taiwan,we conducted a nationwidepopulationbased study to examine the relative risk ofmalignancies, including specific cancer types,in patients with empyema.

# DataSources  

Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) program,which began in 1995,is a mandatory universal health insurance program thatcoversmore than  $99\%$  of the Taiwanese population. The NHIRD is managed by the National Health ResearchInstitutes (NHRI) ofTaiwanand consistsofdetailed healthcare data from more than 28million enrollees.It includes coverage for outpatient,inpatient,emergency,dental,and traditional Chinese medicine services. The Longitudinal Health InsuranceDatabase is a subset of theNHIRD and is a representative database containing 100o,000 patients randomly
