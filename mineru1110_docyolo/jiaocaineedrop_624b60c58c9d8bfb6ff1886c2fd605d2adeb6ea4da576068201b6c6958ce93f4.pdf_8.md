Christy Klinge (seated),Kurt Thompson (center),and Diane Guillard of the Water Resources Institute(WRl)workon digitizing geographical areas to be treated for Gypsy Moth infestation this spring.On January 31,the WRi Information Service Center (ISC)held a Gypsy Moth, GIS workshop where over 20 participants including Ron Priest,Michigan's Gypsy Moth Program Manager,five MDA Regional Supervisors,and Gypsy Moth coordinators from 10 Michigan counties gathered to learn GiS fundamentals as they apply to the Gypsy Moth SuppressionProgram in Michigan.  

The ISC is currently working to digitize approximately 70,oo0 acres in 11 counties.Aerial applicatorswill use this Gls information to greatly increase the efficiency of their spray applications as they target Gypsy Moth infestations in Michigan.
