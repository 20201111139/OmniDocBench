Theseresponses came from ITorganizations in publicsectors,suchasITcentersinuniversities, ministries and institutions as wellas from major IT companies in the Kingdom.Respondents also were kindly asked toresend the survey hyperlink to their colleagues working in the IT sector.Further details about the study sample arepresented in the sample section.  

# RESULTS  

# Validation Tests  

Beforecommencingwiththedataanalysis process, several validation tests were carried out in order to ensure the reliability and discriminantvalidity of theinstruments.For instance, Cronbach alpha test was performed ontheitemsofeachconstruct toensurethe validityofthequestionnaireanditsinternal consistency.Thereliabilityofitemsineach constructrangedfrom0.74forbehavioralintentionto0.92forperceived ease ofuse(Table 1),which exceeded the standard suggested by Nunnally and Bernstein(1994).Therefore,the internalconsistencyof thequestionnairewas within an acceptable range.  

Furthermore, factor analysis was carried outin order to test the convergent and discriminant validity of theinstrument(questionnaire).Atotalof28itemswere analyzedatthe level offourfactors(i.e.,perceived usefulness, perceivedeaseofuse,attitudeandbehavioral intention).Table2showsthecorrelationmatrix for the factoranalysis using principal component analysisasanextractionmethod andVarimax rotation.It canclearlybenoticed thateachitem scored higher (i.e., higher than 0.50) in its construct than any other construct.According to Fornell and Larcker (1981), this result representsasatisfactorylevelofdiscriminate validity and convergence.  

# Sample  

As mentioned previously,the questionnaire was distributed by e-mail to peoplewhowork in information technology organizations in theKingdomofSaudiArabia.A totalof171 completedsurveyswerereceived andusedfor analysis. Seventy-three percent of respondents weremale and themajority of therespondents wereagedbetween20and35yearsold.Table 3 shows a descriptive analysis of sample characteristics.  

# Hypotheses Testing  

The first five hypotheses (i.e.,hypothesis 1-5) tested therelationships amongst theregular TAM constructs (PU,PEU,AT and BI)while therestofthehypotheses(i.e.,hypothesis6-10) tested the effect of the external variables (age, gender,job domain, education and nationality) on attitudestowardscloudcomputinginSaudi organizations. In order to test these hypotheses, linear regression was applied on the obtained data.The results are presented in Table 4. Hypotheses1 and 2 tested the effects of PUand PEU on the AT of cloud computing in Saudi organizationsrespectively.Moreover,hypotheses  $6,7,8,9$  and 10 tested the effect of gender, age, education,job domain andnationality onthe AT of cloud computing in Saudi organizations, respectively.Entering all variables inone block, the results presented a significant percentage ofvariance  $62\%$   $\mathrm{R}2\!=0.65,\mathrm{F}\left(7,\!163\right)\!=37.92,$
