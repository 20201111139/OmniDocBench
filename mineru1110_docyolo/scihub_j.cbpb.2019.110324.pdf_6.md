Fig.5.The expression profiles of ATF/CREBs in XX and XY gonads based on transcriptome data from gonads of tilapia at 5,30,90 and180 dah.Four pairs of RNA preparations from gonads of XX and XY tilapia at 5, 30, 90 and 180 dah were sequenced using Illumina 2000 Hiseq technology in our previous study. A normalized measure of RPKM (reads per kb per million reads) was used to normalize the expression profiles of ATF/CREBs.

$2009$  Tussiwandet al.,2012),indicatingthefunctional conservationof these genesbetween mammals and teleosts during evolution.atf7was preferentially expressed in the brain as reported in the mice(Goetz et al.,1996). The expression pattern of atf7bnot atf7a in tilapia was similar to that of mammalian ATF7 (Zhao et al.,2005).Amazingly, in tilapia,atf7a was specifically expressed in the testisindicating itspotential function in male sex differentiation.Expression pattern shifts following duplication indicated neofunctionalization in atf7a as suggested previously for some regulatory genes(Duarte et al.,2006; Sandve et al.,2018). ATF5 was a highly abundant liver-enriched transcriptionfactorinhuman(Zhao et al.,2005),however,different from human, atf5awas highly expressed in the heart and atf5b showed low expression level invarioustissuesin tilapia.  

In tilapia gonads, some ATF/CREBs expressed sexual dimorphically at different stages of development.Generally,these periodsrepresent fourkeybiological events duringgonadal development of the tilapia: sexdeterminationanddifferentiationat5dah,initiationofgermcell meiosisinovaryat30dah,initiation ofgermcellmeiosisintestisat90 dah, and vitellogenesis in ovary and sperm maturation in testis at 180 dah (Ta0 et al.,2013).The ovary-enriched genes,creb1a, jdp2b and atf4b,werehighlyexpressedat180dah,whileatrelativelylowlevel at early stages with little difference between the ovary and testis,indicating they areimportantfor oogenesis.Forinstance,knockdown of creb1 promotes apoptosis and decreases estradiol synthesis in mouse granulosa cells (Zhang et al.,2018).It was reported that jdp2was a novel negative regulator of FSH induction by gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH1) in female mice (Jonak et al., 2017). However, in tilapia,jdp2a and jdp2bwere ubiquitously expressed in ovary and testis. Theseresults indicated thatin addition toits influence on ovarian development, jdp2 may also play an important role in the development of testis.Among testis-enrichedgenes,except that the expression ofatf4b peaked in90dah,theothers （creb1b,crema,cremb,atf1,atf7a,atf4a)expressed thehighest at 180 dah,followed by 90 dah,suggesting that these genes play an important role in spermatogenesis. Previous research reported thatcremwashighly expressedin spermatogenic cells and crem-mutantmice caused spermiogenesis deficiency andgerm-cell apoptosis (Blendy et al., 1996; Nantel et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2018). Interestingly,in our study,signals of crema were also observed in the phaseI andII oocytesof the ovary.Furtherfunctional characterization of these sexual dimorphically expressed ATF/CREBsusing transgenic over-expressionandknockoutstrategiesmayhelpelucidatetheexact roles of these genes in sex differentiation and gonadal development in teleosts,aswell asin other vertebrates.
