objective annual reporting by the European Commission. The monitoring approach will be the same in everyMemberState.  

There can be no compromise when it comes to defending our core values. Threats to the rule of law challenge the legal, political and economic basis of how ourUnionworks.  

The Commission's monitoring will be done in closedialoguewithnational authoritiesonthe basis of law,notably the recent case law set down by our independent Court of Justice. I will also ensure a greater role for the European Parliamentinthisrule-of-law mechanism.  

The new way forward brings transparency, allows early detection and offers targeted support to resolve any issues at an early stage.  

Our objectiveis tofind a solutionthatprotects theruleoflaw,withcooperation andmutual support,but without ruling out an effective, proportionate and dissuasive response as a lastresort.  

I intend to focus on tighter enforcement, using recent judgements of the Court of Justice showing theimpactofrule-of-lawbreacheson EU law as a basis. I stand by the proposal to make therule of law an integral part of the nextMultiannualFinancialFramework.  

This is  about  strengthening trust  and confidencebetween us,which is as good for ourinternalmarketasitisforourinternal unity.  

TheCommissionwillalways be an independent guardian of the Treaties. Lady Justiceisblind-shewilldefend theruleoflaw wherever andbywhomeveritis attacked.
