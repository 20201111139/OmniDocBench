GP Moore123, B Lemyre123, T Daboval123, S Ding², S Dunn24, S Akiki², N Barrowman², AL Shephard23 and ML Lawson23 OBJECTivE: The objective of this study is to assess and modify an existing decision aid and field-test decision coaching with the modified aid during consultations with parents facing potential delivery at 23 to 24 weeks gestation.  

STUDY DESIGN: International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument (IPDASi) scoring deficits,multi-stakeholder group feedback and a-testing guided modifications.Feasibility/acceptability were assessed.The Decisional Conflict Scale was used to measure participants′ decisional conflict before (T1) and immediately after (T2) the consultation.  

RESULTS: IPDASi assessment of the existing aid (score 11/35) indicated it required updated data, more information and a palliative care description.Following modification,IPDASi score increased to 26/35.Twenty subjects (12 pregnancies) participated in fieldtesting;15 completed all questionnaires.Most participants  $(89\%)$  would definitelyrecommend this form of consultation.Decisional conflictscoresdecreased  $(P<0.001)$  betweenT1  $(52\pm25)$  andT2  $(10\pm16)$  

coNCLusioN:Field testing demonstrated that consultations using the aid with decision coaching were feasible,reduced decisional conflict andmay facilitate shared decision-making.

# INTRODUCTION  

With the prioritizing of patient-centred care,there has been increasing emphasis onpatientinvolvement duringdecisionmaking processes.Shared decision-making (SDM)involvesa collaborativediscussionbetweenhealthcareprofessionals and patients to come to an informed,preference-matched decision. Recentstatementsfromnationalorganizations.3 encouragethe useofSDMwithdecisionsattheneonatallimitofviabilityto enhanceparentalinvolvement.  

In clinical settings,patient decision aids(PtDA)can facilitate SDM. They support the participation of patients in decision making abouthealthcareoptions by improvingpatientknowledge, involvement and values-choice agreement.56 Decision coaching,wheretrained coachesprovidepatientswithindividualized,non-directiveguidance,isoftenused inconjunctionwith PtDAandhassimilarbenefits.4.7.8  

Whenfacingthepotentialdeliveryofanextremelypremature infantat 23to24weeksgestationalage(GA),parentsoften face thechoiceofhaving thehealthcareteamprovideeitherintensive or palliative care for their infant.Although evidence strongly supports the use of PtDA and decision coaching to support patientsindecision-making,minimalevidenceexistsregarding theirusewithparentsmakingalifeordeathdecisionfortheir unborn infant. In 2012,Guillen et al. detailed the systematic developmentandpre-testingofaPtDA for usewhenprenatally counseling parents facing such a decision.The PtDA was understandable during simulated consultations and increased parentalknowledge; however,itlackedstandardized assessment1o,11 andwasnot evaluated inreal-life situations. If a PtDAdoesnot meet thesecertification criteria,itcannegatively affecttheSDMprocessduringclinicaluse.  

Given continued parental dissatisfaction12 and healthcare professionals'difficulties13 withconsultationsatthelimitof viability,the objectives of this study were to:（1)assess and,if necessary,modifyanexisting  $P+D A^{9}$  foruseinourinstitution and (2)field-testdecisioncoachingwiththePtDAwithparentsfacing potentialdeliveryat23or24weeksGAtoevaluatethefeasibility and acceptability of using aPtDA in this situation and to determinetheeffectonparentaldecisionalconflict.  

# METHODS  

The local ethics review boards approved the study.One author (GM) receivedpermissionfromitsdeveloperstomodifyanexisting  $P+D A^{9}$  (six decisioncards and accompanying fourpagescript).  

Thestudywasconducted atTheOttawaHospital,General Campus,and theChildren'sHospitalofEasternOntario.Thestudyincluded threemain stepsasfollows:(1)assessment,(2)modificationanda-testing and(3)field (β)testingofdecisioncoachingwiththemodifiedPtDA.  

# Assessmentofexisting PtDA  

Four authors （GM,S Ding,S Dunn and TD)performed independent assessmentsoftheexisting  $P+D A^{9}$  usingtheInternationalPatientDecision AidStandardsinstrument（IPDASi,v4.o)thatprovidesa frameworkto certify decision support tools through evaluating and improving their content,developmentandimplementation.Nineofthe44IPDASiitems werenotappliedasthePtDAdidnotinvolveascreeningtest.APtDA mustreceiveyes'forallqualifyingcriteriatobeconsideredaPtDA,ascore greaterthan threeonallcertificationcriteriafor IPDAScertificationand scores  $>3$  onqualityitems toindicatebetter PtDAquality.Scoring differenceswere discussed until consensuswas achieved.14Unmet criteria allowedidentificationoftheexistingPtDA'sshortcomings.  

To complement the assessment,an existing multi-stakeholder working group(thatincludedparentsofextremelyprematureinfants)completeda survey torankhealth-relatedfactorsimportanttothedecision thatcould
