increase as the value of  $\mathtt{a}_{390}$  decreases.However,the offset does notexceed  $0.1\;\mathrm{mol}\;\%$  even for the case of  $\mathrm{a}_{390}=1.50$  

The results of this ternary system differ significantly from those of the quaternary systems in terms of the actions of temperature controllers. The studies on quaternary systems concluded that the two temperature controllershad to have the same action.However, dynamically stable results are obtained for this ternary system with temperature controllers having opposite actions.Details of the physical explanation of this situation are given in a recent paper.6  

3.2.TernarySystemwithInertComponent.Theflowsheet of ternary system with inert is given in Figure 9. This system involves four components.However,one ofthem is an inert component  $I$  in terms of the reaction.Since itsvolatility is assumed thesame asthat of thelightreactantA,itisfedfrom the fresh feed stream  $F_{A O}$  as a mixture with A. The other fresh feed stream  $F_{B O}$  contains pure reactantB.While theheavy product  $C$  leaves the column from the bottom,the low-boilinginert  $I$  is removed from the distillate without taking part in the reaction. Thus, the column has three zones: a stripping section, a reactive zone, and a rectifying section.It is assumed that the light and heavy fresh feed streams are fed from thebottom and top trays of the reactive zone,respectively.  

The main design objective is to obtain the purity of the bottomsproductat  $98\;\mathrm{mol}\;\%\;C$  Ontheotherhand,theamount of reactants escaping from the distillate stream should also be considered. This is especially important for the light reactant  $A_{i}$  whichhas an identical volatility with the inert component  $I$  Thus,aconstraintof  $3\,\mathrm{mol}\,\%$  isdefined forthemaximum amount of reactants leaving the column from the top.The liquid holdups in thereactive traysareselected as2000mols tohavereasonable liquid height. The composition of  $F_{A O}$  is  $50\;\mathrm{mol}\;\%\;A$  and  $50\;\mathrm{mol}$   $\%I_{\cdot}$  Kinetic parameters of the ternary system are giveninTable 5. Thebasic design procedure isbased on the existing paper in the literature.21  

The optimization problem for the ternary system withinert includes five design variables. These are (1) the number of stripping trays  $N_{S,}$  (2)thenumber ofreactive trays  $N_{R X}$  and (3) the number of rectifying trays  $N_{R},$  (4) the column pressure  $P_{i}$  and (s)thereflux R.The objective function is  $\mathrm{TAC}_{j}$  and the same basis of economics is used as that hasbeen used for the ternary systemwithoutinertcomponent.  

Table 6 gives the optimum design parameters and economics for therelativevolatility cases considered.For thebasecaseof  $\alpha_{390}=2.00,$  the optimum operating pressure of the column is9 bar.Thebottomspurity of  $98\;\mathrm{mol}\;\%\;C$  is achieved with a column having 7 stripping,12 reactive, and 7 rectifying trays.The column diameteris  $1.00\;\mathrm{m}$  with a vaporboilup of  $55.06\;\mathrm{mol/s}.$  The total capitalinvestment for the column,reboiler,and condenseris  $8532.42\times10^{3},$  while the cost of energy is  $\mathbb{S}237.33\,\times\,10^{3}/\mathrm{yr}$  Assuming a payback period of 3years, the TAC is  $\mathbb{S}414.80\,\times$   $10^{3}/\mathrm{yr}$  There is a slight decrease in the operating pressure with the decrease of  $\mathbb{(}x_{390}$  but the change is not dramatic. This decrease is reasonable because lower pressure helps the VLE by reducing temperatures and increasing relative volatilities. Thereis anincreasein the optimumnumberof total trayswith the decrease of  $\alpha_{390}$  Decrease of  $a_{390}$  from 2.00 to 1.75 results in a higher change in the number of separation trays.On the other hand, the increase in the number of reactive trays is more remarkable for the case of  $\alpha_{390}=1.50$  The other design variable reflux  $R$  and the vapor boilup  $V_{S}$  increase dramatically as  $\mathrm{\bf~\alpha}_{390}$  declines. Thus, the capital and energy costs get significantly higher as the value of  $\alpha_{390}$  decreases.  

Figure10 shows the temperatureprofilesofthreerelative volatility cases.Thereis a sharp temperatureprofilefor thecase of  $\alpha_{390}=2.00$  This is especially true for the stripping section.The decreaseof thevalueof  $\mathrm{~\bf~\alpha~}_{390}$  moderates the sharpnessofthe temperature profle.The size of thehumpin thereactive zone also
