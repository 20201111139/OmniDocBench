# Strategies to manage rising costs  

In the face of declining revenues and rising input prices, many universities are looking atwaystoreduce operating costs.The two biggest cost items for universities are payroll (and pensions liability) and the cost of maintaining and operating campus buildings.Struggling universitiesneed to addresshowtomakecostsavings in these two areas.  

Getting visibility into key cost drivers is a challenge, leading many institutions to engage in tactical cost-cutting exercisesrather thanworking to transformtheircoststructures.Someof these tacticalinitiativesinclude cutting travel budgets,reducing energy bills and tightening spend on consumables byrevisiting procurementprocesses,switching suppliersor renegotiatingcontracts.  

However,thisapproachwas aptlydescribedbya fewuniversityleaders as merelyâ€œtrimming around the margins".To make a real impact on operating costs,tougher decisionswill need to bemade,includinginvesting in technology,scaling back or cutting non-core projects, services or support. A few of the universities interviewed had already undergonemergers to achieveeconomiesofscaleandreduceduplication.  

When considering the best cost reduction strategies,most universities will need to improve their visibility of cost drivers, and in particular to understandwhich costsare fixed,andwhicharevariable.To streamline cost structures,institutionsrequire access tomore granular and up-to-date data on the true costs of running each course and maintaining each center.

generating enough profit to add to   
our reserves. CFO, Public University, US  

# Reluctance toreduce staffheadcount  

Leaders are reluctant to include job reductions in cost-cutting measures, but some have been forced toreduce headcount,tenured status and salary costs to lower expenditure. Other approaches to reducing payroll include cutting non-teaching staff through hiring freezes,replacing leavers with more juniorstaff and merging roles.  

However,theseinitiativeswillonlygetinstitutionssofar.Someuniversities are thinking morestrategically about theirworkforce strategies toprevent over-hiring,using data to predict demand and hire accordingly.  

While headcount reductions save money in the short term, leaders are apprehensive aboutthelonger-term costs associated with these measures. Somenoted thecultural costofredundancies,witha lossofmoraleas remaining staff fear for the safety of their jobs.One Vice Chancellor in Australiasaid thatreducingstaffnumbersinevitablyremovedstaffwho had just been trained or upskilled, creating zero return on this investment. Leaders are also concerned that reducing headcount could erode the capacity ofstaff to engagein essential transformationprojects.  

We invest a lot of money and time in developing people, so to get rid of them only to re-hire them in 12 months doesn't make sense.
