# An InterviewwithDr.RickRediske,Program Manager  

In our advanced research   
laboratories,WRl conducts sophisticated and   
comprehensive environmental analyses and research. This information is the foundation that helps us make decisions about living responsibly within our   
environment.  

The data we are able to extract from thorough testing procedures provides vital input in decisions that affect our choices and our quality of life."  

WhyisitimportantforWRItocontinue toinvestigatethepresenceofchemical contaminatesintheenvironment?  

The testingwedo serves twopurposes.First,it helps define thenature and the extentofaproblemorapotentialproblem.The best meansofprotectingour waterqualityisbypreventingproblems before they occur.That'swhyweneed to continuallyassess theconditionofour environment sowe can detectchanges thatmightsignal apotential problem.
