Gaining staff support is also key to ensuring the tool's continued improvement. Addressing the challenge of data linkage specifically,Katy Brown said:"We are doingmore to communicate to users why, in some instances, they might not be able to view a record or why it is matched incorrectly (i.e.,conflicting information in different case managementsystems),which is not thefault of One View directly. At a high level, this is to try and lift staff understanding of the process and to maintain trust/understandinginthesystem."  

Clear feedback mechanism: it is important to the project team that improvements to One View are drivenbyfrontline staff feedback.Jill Gallagher described how this worksinpractice:Frontline staff give us some great narratives around what's going on for them and how the needs have changed forthe people they're serving.We are able to take that information and then adapt One View tomeet that need." This may involve going back to the individual services to address data quality issues: "We have in some areas gone back to services to address some data quality issues and improve things from the point of data entry."said Rhodri Rowlands.This was echoed byKaty Brown:"lf staff find information in a case summary they know to be wrong, then we are doing a big push for staff to report it,sowe can look at it in the background and amend."  

For example, staff feedback has led to increased frequency of data collection.As described in the Key challengessection,data is extracted at different frequencies and canbe outof date.Debt information used to be extracted monthly,but LBBD have increased the frequency of these extracts toweeklybased onstaff feedback."Wearespeaking tostaff toidentify thepriority datasets and do what we can to increase their frequency and mitigate the impact of 'time'on the data presented," SaidKatyBrown.  

Information governance (IG):for the service delivery team,it's been very reassuring to know that there isrobust IG.Gill Wilson describesher confidence inthe tool'sIGcompliance:"OneView has got a very,very good structure toit that embeds theData Protection Act,the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, so that you know whenever you go in, you only get access to what is at yourlevel.Theformal processaround the dataprotection,but alsotheformal process around the governancestructurewith the board and everything,it all feeds into the managementboard. It'sverygood.It'sverystrong."
