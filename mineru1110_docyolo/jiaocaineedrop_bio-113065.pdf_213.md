# SKELETALMUSCLEPAIRS  

To move bones in opposite directions, skeletal muscles often consist ofmusclepairs thatwork in opposition to one another.For example, when the biceps muscle(on the front of the upper arm) contracts,it cancausetheelbowjointtoflexorbend thearm,asshowninFigure 6.3.5.When the triceps muscle （on the back of the upper arm) contracts,it can cause the elbow to extend or straighten the arm.The biceps and triceps muscles are examples of a muscle pair where the musclesworkinopposition to each other.

# SKELETALMUSCLESTRUCTURE  

Each skeletal muscle consists ofhundreds—or even thousands of skeletal muscle fibers, which are long, string-like cells.As shown in Figure 6.3.6, skeletal muscle fibers are individually wrapped in connectivetissuecalled endomysium.Theskeletalmusclefibers are bundled together in units called muscle fascicles,surrounded by sheaths of connective tissue called perimysium. Each fascicle contains between ten and 100(or even more!) skeletal muscle fibers. Fascicles, in turn, are bundled together to form individual skeletal muscles,which are wrapped in connective tissue called epimysium. The connective tissues in skeletalmuscleshave a varietyof functions. They support and protect muscle fibers, allowing them to withstand contraction forcesby distributing theforces applied to the muscle.They alsoprovidepathwaysfor nervesand bloodvessels to reach the muscles. Also, the epimysium anchors the muscles to tendons.

Figure 6.3.6:Eachskeletal muscle has a structure of bundles within bundles. Bundles of muscle fibers make up a muscle fascicle, and fascicles'bundles makeup a skeletalmuscle.At each level of bundling, a connective tissue membrane surrounds the bundle. The muscle cells, fascicle, and the whole muscle are surrounded by Endomysium, perimysium,and epimysium,respectively. All connectivetissuesmergetogether tomake a tendon thatattachesthe muscletobones.
