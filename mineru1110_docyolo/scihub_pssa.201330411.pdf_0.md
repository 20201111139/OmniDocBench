1  Introduction Despite the progress made in the field of polymer-based organic light emitting diodes (PLEDs) during the last years, continuing efforts in research are necessary for a substantial breakthrough in commercialization. The lifetime and stability of the devices are still one of the main issues in need of improvement [1-5]. Usually, luminance degradation and an increase in operating voltage with prolonged electrical driving are typical features of electrical fatigue in polymer-based OLEDs [4]. Thereby the devicelifetime isnormally defined as the  $t_{50}$  orhalf lifetimethe timeinwhich theluminancedecreases to  $50\%$  fromthe initial value during operation at constant current.  

According to spin statistics, the ratio of singlet to triplet excitons in OLEDs is 1:3. However, differing ratios have been reported for many materials[6-9] but no consensus on the value has been reached. Nevertheless,due to the high lifetime of triplet excitons on the order of several  $\mu s$  to ms [10, 11], high triplet densities are reached in fluorescent devices. The influence of these non-radiatively decaying excitonson the lifetime[12] or efficiency [13-15] of fuorescent OLEDs has beeninvestigated in only few publications. King et al. [12], e.g., reported an increase in the  $t_{50}$  lifetime aswell as a decreasein theinitial luminescence

decay in polyfluorene-based OLEDs after reducing the amount of triplets in the polymer matrix by incorporating a triplet quencher additive into the system.  

In this contribution, the effect of triplet excitons on the degradation of OLEDsisstudied inaPLEDinwhich the polymer is blended with a triplet sensitizer. The presence of the sensitizer leads to the enhancement of the triplet concentration in thematrixsemiconductor. The impact of the higher triplet concentration on device lifetime is monitored. As a result, an accelerated degradation due to the increased triplet-to-singlet ratio will be reported.  

2 Experimental This study focuses on devicesbased on the poly  $p$  -phenylene vinylene) (PPV) derivative  $\mathrm{OC}_{3}C_{8^{-}}$  PPV (poly(2-propoxy-5-(  $2^{\prime}$  -ethylhexyloxy)-phenylene vinylene),which is used both in pristine state and blended with the triplet sensitizer material platinum (Il) octaethylporphyrine ketone (PtOEPK) purchased from Livchem Logistics GmbH. The PLEDs consist of anITO anode,a PEDOT:PSS hole injectionlayer  $(40\,\mathrm{nm})$  ,an  $\mathrm{OC}_{3}\mathrm{C}_{8}\mathrm{-PPV}$  layer  $(130\,\mathrm{nm})$  and a  $\textrm{C a}$  cathode  $(20\,\mathrm{nm})$  protectedby anAl layer  $\mathrm{[00\,nm)}$
