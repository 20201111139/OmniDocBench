thanamelioratetheeffectsofPerceivedStressonSelfEsteem.Asimilaramplificationeffectappearedfor OBS in the analysis of Depression. All significant FFMQcorrelationswithpsychologicalscaleswere in line with theoretical expectations, confirming that each dimension of mindfulness operationalized an adjusted form of self-functioning when examined alone. Amplificationrather than the expectedamelioration effects, therefore, presumably refected intricacies in the dynamic interactions among these proposed selfregulatoryprocesses.Inaddition,theNONJfactor did not correlate with DES and, perhaps most surprisingly, displayed a negative correlation with OBS. Overall, suchfindings confirmed the need to further examine complexities in mindfulness that have already appeared in the recent research literature (e.g.,Feltman,Robinson, &0de,2009).  

FailureofallFFMQfactorstocorrelatepositivitywith each other suggested some degree of independence in how at least some aspects of mindfulness function in Iran.Baer et al. (2006) similarly reported no positive correlationbetweenOBSandNONJinoneoftheirAmerican samples.A negativeNONJ correlation with OBSand its weaker andless consistentrelationshipswiththeother psychological scales indicated that this factor in particular mayneedtobethefocusoffutureIranianresearch.Specifically, items in this factor may express problematic ideas within theIranianMuslim culturalcontext.TwoNONJ statementssay,forexample,Itend toevaluatewhether myperceptions arerightorwrong”(reverse scored)and "I make judgments about whether my thoughts are good or bad”(reverse scored).Muslim beliefs in,for example, self-controlmightmakeitdifficultforIranianstoselfreport the mindfulness of NONJ by rejecting such claims. In short,future research should examine the religious implications ofNONJ in IranianMuslims.  

IntegrativeSelf-Knowledgeproved tobe anespecially noteworthy self-regulatory process.Only this measure, alone or in interaction with Self-Control,displayed theexpectedmediationeffectswithallfourdependent variables.Self-Controlfailed tobeimplicated inselfregulationonlyinthemediationofAnxiety.Additional studiesclearly shouldanalysethese twomeasures in further attempts to understand self-regulation.The one significantinteractionbetween these twomediatorsdid suggest that an especially self-insightful self-control might sometimes make unique contributions to selfregulation,but then again,thefact that only one such interaction proved to be significant alsoimplied that any such contributions might be limited. ThatIntegrative Self-KnowledgeonlysometimesinteractswithSelfControl to produce significant effects was also apparent in the previous examination of Iranian religiousand spiritual functioning（Ghorbani,Watson,Rezazadeh,& Cunningham,2011).

In addition,the student research participants of this studywerenotrepresentativeofeithertheIranian population or of other societies.In theory,the multiprocess model of self-regulation should apply crossculturally,and confirmation of that expectation will require testing in a broader range of cultural contexts. In such research, it presumably will be important to establish the measurement invariance of instruments across societies and not just across genders as was the case with the FFMQ in the present study.
