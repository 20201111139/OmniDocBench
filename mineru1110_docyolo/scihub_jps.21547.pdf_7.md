otherparts.TheSEMpicturesinFigure6show that the liquid preconcentrate exists as a separate phasetrappedintosolidPEG3350clusters. Confocal Raman microscopy described in the next section showed a similar result (Fig. 6c and d):twophases were detected with crystalline needle-likeand irregular shaped domains ofPEG 3350(visualized in green)and a liquid phase (visualized in blue) consisting of Capmul PG8 andCremophorELlocatedbetweenPEG3350 domains.In separate experiments,hot-stage light microscopy studies(not described in this report) showed that the clusters and nodes disappeared uponheating to  $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and reappearedupon coolingbelow  $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  

# CharacterizationofDrug-LoadedSolid Microemulsion Preconcentrates by Confocal Raman Microscopy  

Thecompositionsofthesolidmicroemulsion preconcentratewith $4\%$ and $8\%$ drugloadsselectedforfurther evaluationaspotential dosage forms for I are given in Table 3. For comparison, compositions ofprototype solid dispersions developedpreviously usingPEG3350-polysorbate80 mixtures are also given in the table.  

Onewell-established technique foridentificationandcharacterizationofthesolidstateof pharmaceutical specimens is Raman spectroscopy. It is a robust and reliable method yielding informationofhighqualitywithalowlimitof detection.In addition itrequiresminimal sample preparation and allowsfor high throughput screeningandautomation.27  

In combination with an optical microscope, Raman spectroscopy can be implemented to mapaspecimenandtoprovidespatiallyresolved chemical information on the underlying species.28-32 In recent years, progress in laser equipment,development of highqualityholographicfilters andgratingsaswellas advancesin charge couple device(CCD) technologyhasled to an advent of Raman microscopy. Employing the principle of confocality,modern Raman microspectrometers allow rapid chemical mapping with high spatial and spectral resolution. It is possible to reveal the exact composition and spatial distribution of complex mixtures of drug substances and excipientsata resolutionin the submicrometer range, atvery low concentrations and at apixel resolution of up toseveral hundred thousandpixels.31,33  

In the present investigation,Raman spectra of thecomponentsofsolidmicroemulsionsintheir pure formwerefirstcollected (Fig.7)and used as thebasis for the deconvolution of the experimental data cubes using classical least squares
