the groundwater.Based on these measurements,a gradient in chlorendic acid pollution was observed (Figure 1). In March 2013,24 4-m long hybrid poplar cuttings of the Grimminge cultivar [Populus deltoides  $x^{\prime}$  (Populustrichocarpa  $x^{\prime}$  Populus deltoides)] were planted on the field for future phytoremediation purposes.The trees were distributed over a defined rectangular grid of  $10\,\textrm{m}$  by  $35\,\mathrm{~m~}$  ，enclosing the area with the highest concentrations of chlorendic acid in the groundwater (  $>\!100~\mathrm{mg}$   $1^{-1}$  ）（Figure 1).In 2015, samples for isolation of cultivable fungal strains were collected from soil,rhizosphere and roots of common bent and hybrid poplar.Four soil samples were takenina 1-mperimeter aroundobservationwells OW175-4 and OW149-4 （Figure 1),from surface soil, $-1,-1.5,$ and $-2\;\textrm{m}$  Common bentrhizosphere androotswere sampled inside the 1-m perimeter around each of the observation wells. Poplar rhizosphere and root samples were taken from three trees growingin thezoneswithhighconcentrationsofchlorendicacid (Figure 1).From each tree, four sample repetitions were taken. In total,32soil sampleswerecollected  $4\times4$  depths  $\times2$  locations), 8bentgrassroot andrhizosphere samples  $4\times2$  locations) and 12 poplar rhizosphere and root samples  $4\times3$  trees). Soil sampleswere takenwith steriletools and transported in sterile bags. Roots were collected with soil particles still adhering to the surface,which was considered the rhizosphere fraction.For poplar, the tertiary fine roots were selected. Roots with adhering rhizospherefractionwere obtainedwith sterile tools and directly transferred into falcon tubes with  $30\;\mathrm{rm}$  sterile  $10\;\mathrm{mM}\;\mathrm{MgSO_{4}}$  

# Isolation of Bacteria and Fungi  

Soilsampleswerehomogenizedandvortexedin sterile  $10\ \mathrm{mM}$   $\mathrm{MgSO_{4}}$  prior to isolations.Root and rhizosphere samples were vortexed afterwhich therootswereremoved from the  $\mathrm{MgSO_{4}}$  The resulting soil pellet after centrifugation  $15\,\mathrm{\min}_{\mathrm{\m}}$   $2700g^{\prime}$  constituted the rhizosphere fraction.Poplar roots were surface sterilized by immersing them for  $5\,\textrm{m i n}$  in  $1\%$  NaClO and bunchgrassrootswere sterilizedwith  $0.1\%\mathrm{\DeltaNaClO}$  supplemented with  $0.1\%$  Tween. Following treatment, all roots were rinsed four times in sterile distilled water.The last rinsing solution was platedon869medium (Mergeay et al.,1985) to confirm surface sterility by scoringmicrobialgrowth after7days of incubation at  $30^{\circ}C$  Thesurfacesterilizedrootswereassembledin  $15~\mathrm{ml}$  sterile 10 mM  $\mathrm{MgSO_{4}}$  andmixed for1minusing aPolytronPR1200 mixer(KinematicaA6).  

For fungi isolations,dilutions up to  $10^{-4}$  of the soil, rhizosphere and endophytic root solutions were plated onto peptone-glucose-acid-agar medium  $\mathrm{PH}\ ^{\mathrm{~5~}}$  asdescribedby Dietrich and Lamar (1990),and incubated for 7 days at  $23^{\circ}C$  Afterincubation,all fungalmyceliawere selected,purified and stored on solidmalt extract  $[2\%$  (w/v)]-peptone  $[0.3\%$  (w/v)] medium  $\mathrm{pH}\,5$  at  $4^{\circ}C$  

For bacteria isolation,dilutions of the soil samples were added to a selectiveminimal medium(Sebastian et al.,1996) supplemented with  $25~\mathrm{mg}~1^{-1}$  chlorendic acid as sole carbon source,or with  $3\ \mathrm{mM}$  glucosein addition tochlorendic acid. Every 10 days,  $10\ \mathrm{ml}$  oftheculturewastransferredinto  $90\;\mathrm{{rn}1}$  of freshmedium with a slightlyhigher concentration of chlorendic acid,ultimately leading to  $60~\mathrm{~mg~}1^{-1}$  chlorendic acid after 3monthsofincubationat  $30^{\circ}C$  and  $120\,\mathrm{~rpm}$  At theendof the experiment,chlorendicacid concentrationsweredetermined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The survivingbacterial strainswerepurified and storedin aglycerol solution  $15\%$  (w:v) glycerol;  $0.85\%$  (w:v) NaCll at  $-40^{\circ}C$
