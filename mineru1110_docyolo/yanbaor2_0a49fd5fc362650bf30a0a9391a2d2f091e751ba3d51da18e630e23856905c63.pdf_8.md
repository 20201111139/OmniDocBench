Melissa Wang Consulting Partner On3March2020,therewere125 newlyconfirmedcases and 129newly suspectedcasesofCovID-19in China. That same day, Melissa Wang, a ConsultingPartnerfromDeloitte Western Region office, took off on her first business trip since the pandemicbegan.  

"While I was filling the business travel application form, my colleagues kept asking whether I really had to go." Melissa recalls with a smile. "My client hadreturned totheirofficehalfa month ago.They had tocomplete communication and sign-off on performance by the first quarter, and had encountered implementation challenges. As a key part of the solution, it made sense for Deloitte to bepresent and solve these problems alongside the client. However, after considering everyone's safety, the team decided it should minimize travel frequency, so I went by myself and the project members provided support remotely.' As a result, Melissa completed most of therequired travel alone throughout March.  

With many years' experience inLifeSciences&HealthCare Consulting, Melissa possessed a betterunderstandingof therisks of contracting and spreading COvID-19 than many other colleagues. Colleagues' safety was the first thing that came to Melissa'smind."No one had everencountered thissituation before. My first reaction was to ensure everyone's safety,"she explains."We had to follow the safety guidelines issued by Deloitte, and since I had related knowledge and experience from myLifeSciences&HealthCarework,1 was abletoshareresearchandreports on the epidemic to raise awareness, such as how to effectively prevent the virus and which anti-epidemic materials needed to be prepared."  

"After ensuring the safety of colleagues, I started to think about and planhow to continueprojects amid COvID-19. Havingagreed tomeetclientsafter ChineseNewYear,Ineededto negotiatewith themaboutwhether weshould adjusttoremoteworking
