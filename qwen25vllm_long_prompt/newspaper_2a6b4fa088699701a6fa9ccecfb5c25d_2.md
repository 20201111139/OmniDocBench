SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) requires that, within 12 months after receiving any petition to revise the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants that contains substantial scientific or commercial information indicating that listing an animal or plant species may be warranted, we make a finding (a “12- month finding”). In this finding, we determine whether listing the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog, the Arkansas darter, black mudalia, Highlands tiger beetle, Dichanthelium (=panicum) hirsutii, two Kentucky cave beetles (Louisville cave beetle and Tatum Cave beetle), relict leopard frog, sicklefin redhorse sucker, and Stephan's riffle beetle meet the definition of an endangered or threatened species. More detailed information about these species is provided in the species-specific assessments found online at http:// www.regulations.gov under the appropriate docket number (see ADDRESSES).

In considering what stressors under the Act's five factors might constitute threats, we look beyond the mere exposure of the species to the factor to determine whether the species responds to the factor in a way that causes actual effects to the species. If there is exposure to a factor, but no response, or only a positive response, that factor is not a threat. A threat is a factor that the species responds negatively to, and the negative response may be a threat. In that case, we determine if the stressor rises to the level of a threat, meaning that it may drive or contribute to the risk of extinction of the species such that the species may meet one of the definitions of an endangered or threatened species as those terms are defined by the Act. This does not necessarily require empirical proof of a threat to the species; the best available evidence may demonstrate that the factor is presently affecting species negatively and some corroborating evidence of how the species is likely affected could suffice. The mere identification of stressors that could affect a species negatively is not sufficient to compel a finding that

subsequent finding to be made within 12 months. We must publish these 12- month findings in the Federal Register.

Summary of Information Pertaining to the Five Factors

Section 4 of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and its implementing regulations in title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR part 424) set forth procedures for adding species to, removing species from, and reclassifying species on the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants. The Act defines an endangered species as any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range (16 U.S.C. 1532(6)), and a threatened species as any species that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range (16 U.S.C. 1532(20)). Under section 4(a)(1) of the Act, a species may be determined to be an endangered or a threatened species because of any of the following five factors:

(A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range;

(B) Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes;

(C) Disease or predation;

(D) The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or

(E) Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

We summarize below the information on which we based our evaluation of the five factors provided in section 4(a)(1) of the Act to determine whether the
