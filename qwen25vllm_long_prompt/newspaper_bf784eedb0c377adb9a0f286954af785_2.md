To comply with this requirement, ACL is publishing a notice of the proposed collection of information set forth in this document. With respect to the following collection of information, ACL invites comments on our burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including:

(1) Whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions, including whether the information will have practical utility.

(2) The accuracy of ACL's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions used to determine the burden estimates.

(3) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected.

The evaluation will consist of six data collection activities: (1) Tribal program staff interviews, (2) tribal program staff focus groups, (3) tribal elder focus groups, (4) tribal elder interviews, (5) tribal caregiver focus groups, and (6) tribal caregiver program staff interview. ACL is requesting to revise the currently approved data collection under OMB 0985–0059 by adding the caregiver focus group and adding a follow-up tribal program staff interview. The proposed revisions also include minor modifications to the reporting data elements from the currently approved IC under OMB 0985–0059 to the ACL approved Title VI Annual Performance Report under OMB 0985– 0007.
