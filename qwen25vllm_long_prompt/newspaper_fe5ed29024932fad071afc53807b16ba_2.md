those for free tonnage raisins, such as government purchase, distilleries, or animal feed.

The volume regulation percentages are intended to help stabilize raisin supplies and prices in the face of uncertain market conditions. The Committee unanimously recommended final percentages on February 12, 2004.

## Computation of Trade Demands

Section 989.54(a) of the order describes procedures and time frames to be followed in establishing volume regulation. This includes methodology used to compute trade demand data, and other matters relating to the supplies of raisins of all variety types. The Committee computes the trade demand for each variety type for which a free tonnage percentage might be recommended. Trade demand is computed using a formula specified in the order and, for each variety type, is equal to 90 percent of the prior year's shipments of raisins, less the prior year's tonnage raisins sold for free use into all market outlets, adjusted by subtracting the carryin inventory at the start of the current crop year, and adding the desirable carryout at the end of that crop year. As specified in § 989.54(a)(4), the desirable carryout inventory shall equal the total shipments of free tonnage during June, August, September and one-half of October for each of the past 5 crop years, converted to a natural condition basis, dropping the high and low figures, and dividing the remaining sum by three, or 100,000 tons on a natural condition tons basis, whichever is higher. For all other variety types, the desirable carryout shall equal the total shipments of free tonnage during June, August, September and one-half of October for each of the past 5 crop years, converted to a natural condition basis, dropping the high and low figures, and dividing the remaining sum by three.

At its August 14, 2003, meeting, the Committee computed and announced the 2003–04 trade demand for NS raisins at 219,933 tons. The August trade demand calculation did not account for Olease Seedless raisins (Oleates). Beginning with the 2003–04 crop year, the NS raisin variety type was revised to include Oleates (68 FR 42943; July 21, 2003). Prior to that time, Oleates were a separate variety type. The Oleate and NS raisin trade demands were calculated separately. Then the two individual trade demand figures were added together to obtain a combined trade demand reflecting the new combined varietal type. The Committee establishes a 500-ton minimum trade demand for any varietal type for which the computed trade demand is zero or less. The computed trade demand for Oleates was less than zero, so the Committee established the trade demand for Oleates at 500 tons. At its request, the Committee met on September 9, 2003, and recomputed the combined NS trade demand to account for Oleates at 211,493 tons (219,933 plus 500).

### COMPUTED TRADE DEMANDS (NATURAL CONDITION TONS)

|  | NS raisins |
| --- | --- |
| Prior year's shipments | 297,176 |
| Multiplied by 90 percent | 0.90 |

| Minus carryin inventory | 116,465 |
| Plus desirable carryout | 60,000 |
| Plus Olease minimum trade de- | 210,993 |
| mand tons | 500 |
| Equals revised trade demand | 211,493 |

## Computation of Preliminary Volume Regulation Percentages

Section 989.54(b) of the order requires that the Committee announce, on or before October 5, preliminary crop estimates and percentages while the current volume regulation is warranted for the varietal types for which it computes trade demand. The order also allows the Committee to extend the October 5 date up to 5 business days if warranted by a delay in obtaining data.

The Committee met on October 2, 2003, and announced a preliminary crop estimate for NS raisins of 276,931 tons, which was 20 percent greater than the 10-year average of 230,419 tons. NS raisins are the major varietal type of California raisins. Adding the Olease inventory of 116,465 tons to the 276,931-ton crop estimate resulted in a total available supply of 393,396 tons. This was 85 percent greater than the 2003–04 trade demand of 211,493 tons. Thus, the Committee determined that volume regulation for NS raisins was warranted. The Committee announced preliminary free and reserve percentages for NS raisins, based on the 2003–04 trade demand. The computed trade demand since the field price (price paid by handlers to growers for their free tonnage raisins) had been established. The preliminary percentages were 65 percent free and 35 percent reserve.

In addition, preliminary percentages were announced for Other Seedless raisins. It was ultimately determined that volume regulation was only warranted for NS raisins. As in past seasons, the Committee submitted its marketing policy to USDA for review.

## Computation of Final Volume Regulation Percentages

At its February 12, 2004, meeting, the Committee announced interim percentages for NS raisins to release quantity less than the full trade demand. Based on a revised NS crop estimate of 304,072 tons (up from October's estimate of 276,931 tons), interim percentages for NS raisins were announced at 69.75 percent free and 30.25 percent reserve.

Pursuant to the order, the Committee also recommended final percentages at its February 2004 meeting to release the full trade demand for NS raisins. Final percentages were recommended at 70 percent free and 30 percent reserve. The Committee's calculations to arrive at final percentages for NS raisins are shown in the table below.

### FINAL VOLUME REGULATION PERCENT- AGES (NATURAL CONDITION TONS)

|  | NS raisins |
| --- | --- |
| Trade demand | 211,493 |
| Divided by crop estimate | 304,072 |
| Equals free percentage | 70 |
| 100 minus free percentage | 30 |
| Equals reserve percentage | 30 |

In addition, USDA's “Guidelines for Fruit, Vegetable, and Specialty Crop Marketing Orders” (Guidelines) specify that 110 percent of recent years' sales should be made available to primary markets each season for marketing orders utilizing reserve pool authority. The Committee's trade demand for raisins by the establishment of free percentages, which released almost 100 percent of the trade demand and offered additional offers' reserve raisins for sale to handlers for free pursuant to § 989.54(g) (“10 plus 10 offers”), and § 989.67(l) of the order.

As specified in § 989.54(g), the 10 plus 10 offers are two offers of reserve pool raisins, which are made available to handlers through each offer. For each such offer, a quantity of reserve raisins equal to 10 percent of the prior free sale handlers' free tonnage raisins for free use. Handlers may sell their 10 plus 10 raisins to any market.

For NS raisins, the first 10 plus 10 offer was made in February 2004, and the second offer was made in April 2004. All 10 plus 10 raisins made available to raisin handlers through these offers, and all of the raisins were purchased. Adding the total figure of 61,026 tons of 10 plus 10 raisins to the
