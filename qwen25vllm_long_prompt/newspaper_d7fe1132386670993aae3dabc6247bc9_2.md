SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Abstract

Form BE-140, Benchmark Survey of Insurance Transactions by U.S. Insurance Companies with Foreign Persons, obtains annual data from all U.S. insurance companies that engage in the following eight categories of insurance transactions: (1) Premiums earned on reinsurance assumed from insurance companies resident abroad; (2) losses incurred on reinsurance assumed from insurance companies resident abroad; (3) premiums earned on primary insurance sold to foreign persons; (4) losses incurred on primary insurance sold to foreign persons; (5) premiums incurred on reinsurance ceded to insurance companies resident abroad; (6) losses recovered on reinsurance ceded to insurance companies resident abroad; (7) receipts for auxiliary insurance services; and (8) payments for auxiliary insurance services.

The survey requires companies with additional insurance companies with transactions in at least one of the eight categories listed above that exceed $2 million to report and consolidate data on the amount of their insurance transactions for each category.

The data are used to estimate U.S. international trade in insurance services, analyze its impact on the U.S. economy, and help BEA compile and improve the U.S. economic accounts. The data support U.S. commercial strategy in insurance services, conduct trade promotion, and improve the ability of U.S. businesses to identify and evaluate market opportunities.

The survey is conducted at five-year intervals; it was last conducted for 2008 and will be conducted again for 2013. The 2013 survey will be sent in March 2014, and reports are due by June 30, 2014.

Two changes are proposed for the 2013 BE-140 survey: (1) drop questions on finite reinsurance because finite reinsurance is a dated concept that is no longer used; and (2) add questions to identify the transaction code, size, type and nature of large and irregular transactions, defined as those contracts that continuously generate amounts in excess of $1 billion and that are at least three times the size of a reporter's average transaction. The new information will allow BEA to measure more accurately insurance services on an accrual basis and to exclude transactions that are not related to insurance services.

II. Method of Collection

The surveys are sent to the respondents in the U.S. mail and are also available from the BEA Web site. Respondents may return the surveys one of four ways: U.S. mail, electronically using BEA's electronic collection system (ePATS), fax, or email.
