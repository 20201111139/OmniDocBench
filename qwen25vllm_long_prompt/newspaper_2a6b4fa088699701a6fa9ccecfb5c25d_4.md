Finding

Based on our review of the best available scientific and commercial information pertaining to the Act's five threat factors, we conclude that the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog does not meet the significance criterion of the DPS Policy, as detailed above, and, therefore, is not a valid DPS under our DPS Policy. As a result, we find that the Huachuca- Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog is not a listable entity under section 3(16) of the Act. Therefore, we find that listing the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog as an endangered or a threatened species is not warranted at this time for a significant portion of its range at this time, and consequently, we are removing the species from candidate status.

As a result of the Service's 2011 multidistrict litigation settlement with the Center for Biological Diversity and WildEarth Guardians, the Service is required to submit a proposed listing rule or a not-warranted 12-month finding to the Federal Register by September 30, 2019 (16 U.S.C. Endangered Species Act Section 4 Deadline Litigation, No. 1:10-cv-00146 (ECF), Docket No. 1163 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2011)), for all 251 species which were included as candidate species in the Service's November 9, 2010, CNOR. This document satisfies the requirements of that settlement agreement for the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog. A detailed discussion of the basis for this finding can be found in the species-specific assessment form for the Huachuca-Canelo population of the Arizona treefrog and its supporting documents (see ADDRESSES, above).

Arkansas Darter (Etheostoma cragini)

Previous Federal Actions

The Arkansas darter was first identified as a candidate for listing under the Act in 1989 (54 FR 554; January 5, 1989), as a Category 2 candidate. Category 2 candidate species were identified as those taxa for which the Service possessed information indicating listing the taxa was possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat sufficient to support a proposed listing rule was lacking. On February 28, 1996, the CNOR (61 FR 7596) discontinued recognition of Category 2-3. Because listing the Arkansas darter was warranted but precluded, we assigned the species an LPN of 5. In 2002, we changed the LPN from 5 to 11 (67 FR 40637; June 13, 2002).

On May 11, 2004, the Service received a petition dated May 4, 2004, from the Center for Biological Diversity and Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, requesting the Arkansas darter. The Service published the 12-month finding in the Federal Register on December 12, 2006, reaffirmed determination that listing was warranted but precluded and that the taxon had an LPN of 11 (70 FR 73576). December 6, 2007 (72 FR 75176), November 6, 2009 (74 FR 57804), November 10, 2010 (75 FR 69222), October 26, 2011 (76 FR 66570), November 21, 2012 (77 FR 69608), November 22, 2013 (78 FR 70104), December 5, 2014 (79 FR 72450), and December 24, 2015 (80 FR 80584)).

Background

The Arkansas darter (Etheostoma cragini) is a small fish in the perch family native to the Arkansas River basin. The species occurs most often in small, spring-fed streams and marshes, with cool water, and broad-leaved aquatic vegetation. Arkansas darters prefer flowing, spring-fed streams and pools in contact with groundwater. The species is very tolerant to periods of very poor water quality, including high water temperatures, low dissolved oxygen, and organic and hypereutrophication.

The Arkansas darter's range includes parts of Colorado, southwest and central Kansas, northwest and northeast Oklahoma, southwest Missouri, and northern New Mexico. Recent surveys have expanded our knowledge of occupied Arkansas darter populations. We currently consider to be extant a total of 80 populations across 15 metapopulations rangewide. This is more than we knew of for previous assessments of this species.

Summary of Status Review

In completing our status review for the Arkansas darter, we reviewed the best available scientific and commercial information and compiled it into the Species Status Assessment Report (SSA Report) for the Arkansas darter. In previous candidate assessments and findings for this species, the identified threats we considered were water depletion, water quality degradation, urbanization and development, confined-animal feeding operations, dams and reservoirs, salt cedar invasion, disease, and predation. Although localized negative effects have been observed, all of these stressors are currently occurring at a limited scale and scope, and the overall impact at the population and species level is low.

Water depletion is the stressor with the largest potential impact to the Arkansas darter, currently affecting approximately 25 percent of the geographic range, resulting mainly from groundwater withdrawals for agriculture. Seasonal low flows and intermittency of streams are common within the Great Plains portion of its range, and the species is well adapted to this phenomenon. However, the continued existence of the species in these areas depends on localized areas of refugia, typically those exist where groundwater comes to the surface and create permanent pools or springs that do not dry up during the course. When seasonal precipitation occurs and the streams become flowing systems, the species disperses, the stream then provides habitat for spawning, rearing, and dispersal of young and adult individuals throughout the watershed. Climate change projections forecast minimal change in average annual precipitation in the Arkansas darter's range, as well as forecast reduced or diminished streamflow as a result of future changes in temperature. However, overall, we do not expect to see climate-change- driven decreased trends in precipitation and related stream flows.

Water depletion in reduced resiliency of populations affected in the portions of the range in southwestern Kansas, northwest Oklahoma, and parts of Colorado, approximately 25 percent of the range. However, the species' continued presence of groundwater withdrawals in these areas, indicating continued resiliency of these populations. The large number of populations (80) spread across the multi-State range provides the Arkansas darter species with a high level of redundancy, such that a catastrophic event occur somewhere within its occupied range. Multiple populations and metapopulations are occupying the unique ecological settings of the three unique physiogeographic areas, the same physiogeographic areas that this species has occupied historically, allow the species to maintain adaptive potential and the underlying ecological processes that to changing environmental conditions.
