fishery are required to have valid AFA permits on board the vessel or on site at the processing plant.

With the exception of the inshore vessel contract vessel replacement vessel, and inshore vessel contract fishing applications, the AFA permit program had a one-time application deadline of December 31, 2000. All permit participants in the AFA pollock fishery are already established with an indefinite expiration date.

In a previous response to this collection, a PSC limit of Chinook salmon was established for the pollock industry participants in an industry-developed contractual agreement, called an incentive plan agreement (IPA) that establishes an incentive program to minimize bycatch at all levels of Chinook salmon abundance. NMFS issues transferable Chinook salmon PSC allocations to eligible entities in the catcher/ processor sector, the mothership sector, inshore cooperatives, and CDQ groups. Transferable allocations allow for the flexibility to minimize the bycatch of pollock while maintaining Chinook salmon bycatch at or below the PSC limit.

Abstract: The notary signature requirements have been removed from the Application for Replacement Vessel and the Application for Inshore Catcher Vessel Contract Fishing Permit.

Affected Public: Business or other for-profit organizations.

Frequency: Annually and on occasion.

Respondent's Obligation: Required to obtain or retain benefits.

Desk Officer: OIRA, 202-395-7800.
