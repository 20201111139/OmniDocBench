Pello, Senior Marketing Specialist, California Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order and Agreement Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, AMS, USDA, 2200 Monterey Street, Suite 201, Salinas, CA 93901; telephone: (559) 487–5901; Fax: (559) 487–5906; or George Kelhart, Technical Adviser, Marketing Order and Agreement Branch, Fruit and Vegetable Programs, AMS, USDA, 1400 Independence Avenue SW., STOP 0237, Washington, DC 20250–0237; telephone: (202) 720–2494; Fax: (202) 720–8938.

**SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:** This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 989 (7 CFR part 989), both as amended, regulating the handling of raisins produced from grapes grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the “order.” The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601–674), hereinafter referred to as the “Act.”

The Act is administered by the Secretary in conformity with Executive Order 12866.

The rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12988, Civil Justice Reform. Under the order provisions now in effect, final free and reserve percentages are made available for raisins acquired by handlers during the crop year. This rule continues to establish final free and reserve percentages for NS raisins for the 2003–04 crop year, which began August 1, 2003, and ended July 31, 2004. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule.

The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court under section 608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. Such handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After hearing the USDA would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction to review the USDA's ruling on the petition, provided an action is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.

This rule continues in effect final volume regulation percentages for 2003–04 crop NS raisins under the order. The volume regulation percentages are 70 percent free and 30 percent reserve, and were established through an interim final rule issued on April 22, 2004 (69 FR 21695). Free tonnage raisins may be sold by handlers to the Committee for the account of the Committee and are disposed of through various programs authorized under the order. For example, free tonnage raisins may be sold by the Committee to handlers for free use or to replace part of the free tonnage raisins that were used in diversion programs; carried over as a hedge against a short crop; or disposed in other outlets but the Committee's meetings were widely publicized throughout the sweet onion industry and all interested persons were invited to attend the meetings and participate in Committee deliberations on the issues. Like all Committee meetings held on December 8, 2003, and the February 10, 2004, meetings were public meetings and all entities, both large and small, were able to express their views.

An interim final rule concerning this action was published in the Federal Register on April 26, 2004 (69 FR 22377). Comments were invited and mailed by the Committee's staff to all Committee members and Walla Walla sweet onion handlers. In addition, the rule was made available through the Internet by the Office of the Federal Register and the USDA. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended June 28, 2004. No comments were received.

A small business guide on complying with fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop programs is available and may be viewed at: http://www.ams.usda.gov/fv/moab.html. Any questions about the compliance guide should be sent to Jay Guerber at the previously mentioned address in the FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT section.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the Committee's recommendation, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the Federal Register at 69 FR 22377, April 26, 2004, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
