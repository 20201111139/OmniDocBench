(data not shown), consistently with the results for LB, all mutant strains showed significantly increased maximum rates of growth (μmax<sub>wt</sub>, 0.14; μmax<sub>ΔcrtX</sub>, 0.22; μmax<sub>ΔcrtE</sub>, 0.24; and μmax<sub>ΔcrtY</sub>, 0.19; \(P = 0.000\)).

Cold stress experiments were performed by growing ΔcrtE, ΔcrtX, and ΔcrtY in LB and M9 medium at 10°C (for results in M9, see Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, no significant differences in maximum specific growth rates were detected for ΔcrtY, ΔcrtE, and ΔcrtX in both LB and M9 compared to those of the wild type (in LB, μmax<sub>wt</sub> = 0.04, μmax<sub>ΔcrtX</sub> = 0.03, μmax<sub>ΔcrtE</sub> = 0.03, and μmax<sub>ΔcrtY</sub> = 0.04; in M9, μmax<sub>wt</sub> = 0.01, μmax<sub>ΔcrtX</sub> = 0.01, μmax<sub>ΔcrtE</sub> = 0.01, and μmax<sub>ΔcrtY</sub> = 0.01).

To evaluate growth under acidic conditions, wild-type and
