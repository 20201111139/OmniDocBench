and fill in the form with the following information:

- Bank name;

- Banker's name;

- Telephone number of banker;

- Address of bank;

- Requested bid allowance amount.

EnergyNet will verify that the bank is an acceptable financial institution and contact the bank to ensure the prospective buyer has the financial means to cover the requested bid allowance. The bidder must contact its banker and grant permission for the banker to speak with EnergyNet about the bidder's bid allowance request. EnergyNet will not request the bidder's account balance nor ask any questions about asset value or amount of credit. EnergyNet will not request the bank account number, nor whether it can withdraw funds.

Payments to the BLM will not be made through EnergyNet. At the conclusion of the auction and for the final parcel, the bidder with the highest accepted bid during the open auction period (winning bidder) for each parcel will be provided with instructions via email by the online auction system on how to make the required payment to the BLM. In addition, the winning bidder will pay a service fee to EnergyNet's broker of 1.5 percent of the highest qualifying bid for each parcel purchased by the successful high bidder. The bidder will submit one invoice via email to each successful high bidder for the total amount due to the broker. The bidder will invoice for the amount due to EnergyNet's broker.

Bidding will begin at the established FMV of each parcel. Each parcel will have its own unique open bidding period, with clearly set stop times clearly identified on the auction website. The open bidding period for each parcel will run for 24 hours from start to finish, and only bids placed during the open bidding period will be accepted. Bidding will close sequentially so that each bidder will know if it is the highest qualifying bid before subsequent parcels close. The website will display each current high bid, and the high bidder's name.

The online auction allows participants to submit maximum bids, which is the highest amount a bidder is willing to pay for such parcel. This allows a bidder to participate in the online auction without having to be logged into the website at the time auction periods close. The BLM strongly encourages potential bidders to review the bidding tutorial in the Frequently Asked Questions area on the auction website in advance of the sale. EnergyNet will declare the highest qualifying bid as the high bid. The successful high bidder must submit a deposit of no less than 20 percent of the successful bid amount by 4:00 p.m., Pacific Time, immediately following the acceptance of the bid in the form of a certified check, postal money order, electronic fund transfer, bank draft, or cashier's check, payable in U.S. dollars to the "Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management."

The BLM will send the successful high bidder a confirmation letter with detailed information for making the full payment in accordance with 43 CFR 2711.3–1(d). The successful bidder will forfeit the bid deposit if it fails to pay the full purchase price within 180 days of the sale. The BLM may make no further contact with the bidder. The BLM cannot accept the remainder of the bid payment at any time following the 180th day after the sale.

If a high bidder is the successful high bidder with respect to multiple parcels and that bidder fails to submit the minimum 20 percent bid deposit resulting in a default on a single parcel following the sale, the BLM may cancel the sale of all parcels to that bidder. If the BLM is unable to consummate the transaction for any reason, the BLM may consider the second highest bidder as the successful high bidder. If there are no acceptable bids, a parcel may remain available for sale on a future date without further public notice.

The BLM EYDO must receive requests for escrow instructions a minimum of 30 business days prior to the scheduled closing date. There are no exceptions.

All name changes and supporting documents must be received by the BLM EYDO by 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time, 30 days from the date on the acceptance of bid letter. There are no exceptions. To ensure timely processing, the successful bidder must submit the name change in writing on the Certificate of Eligibility form to the BLM EYDO.

The successful high bidder must remit the full bid price for the parcel no later than 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time, within 180 days of the date of the sale. The successful bidder must submit payment in the form of a certified check, postal money order, bank draft, cashier's check, or electronic fund transfer payable in U.S. dollars to the "Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management" to the BLM EYDO. The BLM will not accept personal checks or other non-certified funds.

Arrangements for electronic fund transfer to the BLM for payment of the balance due must be made a minimum of two weeks prior to the payment date. The BLM will not sign any documents until the full bid price is received. The bidder is responsible for timing for completion of such an exchange. The BLM cannot be a party to any 1031 Exchange.

In accordance with 43 CFR 2711.3– 1(f), the BLM may reject or reject any offer or exchange that would encumber any parcel or interest therein from sale within 30 days, if the BLM determines that the proposed disposition or consumption of the sale would be inconsistent with any law, or for other reasons as determined by applicable law or regulations. No contractual or other rights against the United States may accrue until the BLM officially accepts the offer to sell, and the full bid price is paid.

Upon publication of this notice in the Federal Register, the described land will also be segregated from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, including location under the mining laws, except for the sale provisions of the FLPMA. Upon publication of this notice and until consummation of the sale, the BLM will no longer accept land use applications affecting the parcels identified for sale. The parcels will be subject to valid existing rights. Applications received prior to publication of this notice if processing the application would have no significant effect on the availability of title or the FMV of the parcels. The segregative effect of this notice terminates upon the issuance of a patent or other document of conveyance to such lands, or publication in the Federal Register of termination of the segregation. The total segregation period may not exceed two years unless it is extended by the BLM Nevada State Director in writing (see 43 CFR 2711.3–1(f) for time in accordance with 43 CFR 2711.3–1(f)).

Terms and Conditions: FLPMA Section 202(a), 43 U.S.C. 1719(a), states that "all conveyances of title issued by the Secretary...shall reserve to the United States all minerals in the lands." The patent, when issued, will contain a mineral reservation to the United States for all minerals.

The BLM does not request to clarify this mineral reservation as it relates to mineral materials, such as sand and gravel, we refer you to the policy at 43 CFR 3601.710(b), which provides that the owner of the surface estate of lands so reserved to Federal mineral ownership "use a minimal amount of mineral materials" for "personal use" within the boundaries of the surface estate without a sales contract or permit.
