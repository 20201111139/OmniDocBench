### HPV 6 and HPV 16 E2 bind preferentially to sites with an A:T-rich spacer

Unlike the BPV E2 DBD, the DBD from the HPV 16 and HPV 18 E2 proteins bind preferentially to sites with an A:T-rich central spacer. \({ }^{7,12}\) Since the spacer region is not contacted directly by the DBD, this difference in binding specificity must be due to the overall conformation or flexibility afforded by these base-pairs to the surrounding DNA. To compare the binding of the HPV 16 and HPV 6 E2 DBDs to E2 sites with different central base-pairs, we made a series of E2 binding sites with either AATT, ACGT, or CCGG in the spacer region. Table 2 shows the affinity of the HPV 16 and HPV 6 E2 DBD for these sites (K<sub>eq(app)</sub>). Both proteins bind preferentially to an E2 site with an A:T-rich spacer (Table 2, line 1). Changing the central spacer to either ACGT or CCGG, decreases binding by a factor of around tenfold in the case of the HPV 16 DBD and by more than 1000-fold in the case of the HPV 6 DBD. The values for the HPV 16 E2 DBD differ somewhat from the 30-fold degree of preference reported previously for the binding of this protein to E2 sites with these spacer regions. \({ }^{12}\) One possibility is that this could be a consequence of the different types of oligonucleotides used in each study. Whilst we have used pairs of short complementary oligonucleotides, the previous study made use of single long oligonucleotides that anneal intramolecularly to form a hairpin of double-stranded DNA. \({ }^{12}\)

### HPV 16 and HPV 6 E2 recognise an extended binding site

An alignment of the four E2 binding sites present within the HPV 16 LCR produces a consensus sequence that differs from that derived from the
