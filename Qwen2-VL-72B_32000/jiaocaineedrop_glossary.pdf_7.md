# Glossary

## P

- **power function (704)**: a function in the form \( y = x^b \), where \( b \) is a real number
- **prediction equation (38)**: an equation suggested by the points of a scatter plot used to predict other points
- **pre-image (88)**: the graph of an object before a transformation
- **principal values (406, 456)**: the unique solutions of a trigonometric equation if the values of the function are restricted to two adjacent quadrants
- **prisoner point (816)**: If the iterates do not approach infinity for some initial value, that point is called a prisoner point.
- **prisoner set (599)**: the set of initial values for which the iterates of a function do not approach infinity
- **probability (852)**: the measure of the chance of a desired outcome happening
- **pure imaginary number (206, 581)**: the complex number \( a + bi \) when \( a = 0 \) and \( b \neq 0 \)

## Q

- **quadrantal angle (278)**: an angle in standard position whose terminal side coincides with one of the axes
- **quartile (909)**: one of four groupings of a set of data determined by the median of the set and the medians of the sets determined by the median

## R

- **radian (343)**: the measure of a central angle whose sides intercept an arc that is the same length as the radius of the circle
- **radical equation (251)**: an equation that contains a radical expression with the variable in the radicand
- **radical inequality (253)**: an inequality that contains a radical expression with the variable in the radicand
- **radius**: See circle.
- **random sample (927)**: a sample in which every member of the population has an equal chance to be selected
- **range (890)**: the difference of the greatest and least values in a set of data
- **range of a relation (5)**: the set of all ordinates of the ordered pairs of a relation
- **rate of change (956)**: the derivative of a function when applied to real-world applications
- **rational equation (243)**: an equation that consists of one or more rational expressions
- **rational function (180)**: the quotient of two polynomials in the form \( f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)} \), where \( h(x) \neq 0 \)

## S

- **sample space (852)**: the set of all possible outcomes of an event
