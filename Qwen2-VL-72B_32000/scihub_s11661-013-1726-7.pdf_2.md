contents of Mn and Si, which is consistent with the literature. \({ }^{[16,30]}\) After being SHTed for 8 hours, almost the entire amount of Al\(_2\)Cu is dissolved into the Al matrix as shown in Figure 2(b). It is also interesting to note that the Chinese script \(\alpha\)-Fe phase becomes unstable and is transformed into a small amount of short intermetallic platelets, leading to the fragmentation of the \(\alpha\)-Fe.

The chemical compositions of the iron-rich intermetallics in Alloy B in the as-cast and SHTed (for 8 hours) conditions measured by SEM-EDS are shown in Table II. It can be found that higher Al contents are detected in the \(\alpha\)-Fe and STed \(\beta\)-Fe after SHT than the corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from the liquid. This can be attributed to the partial contribution of the surrounding Al matrix due to the small sizes of the fragmented \(\alpha\)-Fe and STed \(\beta\)-Fe particles after SHT. Compared with the as-cast condition, it can be found that the iron content in \(\alpha\)-Fe is reduced after SHT for 8 hours. As shown in Figure 2(c), however, the EBSD results with a mean angular deviation (MAD) of 0.452, lower than 0.7 which is considered to be critical for an accurate solution, \({ }^{[31]}\) indicate that this phase is still the \(\alpha\)-Fe (body-centered cubic with \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) as 1.265 nm \({ }^{[11]}\)). Moreover, the platelet-like intermetallic phase formed during the SHT has a similar chemical composition to the \(\beta\)-Fe obtained in the as-cast condition (Table II) and thus is termed as solid-state-transformed \(\beta\)-Fe (STed \(\beta\)-Fe) to distinguish it from the \(\beta\)-Fe directly precipitated from liquid metal during solidification. The formation of the STed \(\beta\)-Fe is further confirmed a low MAD value of 0.258 as measured by EBSD (Figure 2(d)). The STed \(\beta\)-Fe is most likely to have the same crystal structure as the solidified \(\beta\)-Fe (tetragonal with \(a\) and \(b\) of 0.634 nm and \(c\) of 1.488 nm \({ }^{[11]}\)) due to their similar diffraction patterns. However, the STed \(\beta\)-Fe has lower Cu content than the \(\beta\)-Fe (Table II), and the replacement of the Cu by Al
