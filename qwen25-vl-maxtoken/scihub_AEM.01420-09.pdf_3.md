(data not shown), consistently with the results for LB, all mutant strains showed significantly increased maximum rates of growth (\(\mu_{\text {max}_{\text {wt }}}\), 0.14; \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtX}}}\), 0.22; \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtE}}}\), 0.24; and \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtY}}}\), 0.19; \(P=0.000)\).

Cold stress experiments were performed by growing \(\Delta\)crtE, \(\Delta\)crtX, and \(\Delta\)crtY in LB and M9 medium at 10Â°C (for results in M9, see Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, no significant differences in maximum specific growth rates were detected for \(\Delta\)crtY, \(\Delta\)crtE, and \(\Delta\)crtX in both LB and M9 compared to those of the wild type (in LB, \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\text {wt }}}=0.04\), \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtX}}}=0.03\), \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtE}}}=0.03\), and \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtY}}}=0.04\); in M9, \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\text {wt }}}=0.01\), \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtX}}}=0.01\), \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtE}}}=0.01\), and \(\mu_{\text {max}_{\Delta \text {crtY}}}=0.01\)).
