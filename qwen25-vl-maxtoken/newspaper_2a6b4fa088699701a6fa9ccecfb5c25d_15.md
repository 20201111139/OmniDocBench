believed to be affecting the species at present. As many of them were largely historical, were less significant than previously thought, have been mitigated, or could be managed to alleviate their effects on the species. The sicklefin redhorse sucker likely experienced substantial range contraction associated with dam construction, urbanization, and general, and historical habitat degradation early in the 20th century, but the remaining populations appear well established within the present conditions and are successfully spawning and recruiting in four primary river drainages accessible from Hiwassee and Fontana Reservoirs.

In the future, we expect human population growth and land development to continue. These factors affect habitat quality in the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker. However, compared to historical land use effects, we expect the effects of current and future activities to be minimized by more stringent State and local land quality regulations, such as required by current regulations for land development and water quality, and a trend of diminishing agriculture in the area. However, land use practices are likely attributable to the modern regulatory environment that provides protection for the stream environment. The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1934 (16 U.S.C. 661 et seq.), National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, Clean Water Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), North Carolina Sediment and Pollution Control Act of 1973, Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, as well as other regulatory actions, were enacted to control impacts of land development and pollution on the aquatic environment. Historical records indicate that the existing populations of the sicklefin redhorse sucker have persisted through significant agricultural land disturbance that resulted in substantial degradation of its habitat, indicating that the sicklefin redhorse sucker is likely able to tolerate moderate land disturbance. Rural development and the growth of several small towns within the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker appear to be the most likely forms of land use disturbance. Rural development is limited in certain areas due to large portions of the land in the region are permanently protected by inclusion in the Nantahala and Chattahoochee National Forests. This land is currently experiencing a trend of diminishing agricultural land use, indicating that widespread conversion to farmland is not likely. Commercial development is likely to be limited by a lack of large metropolitan areas or interstate highways that would facilitate rapid growth. The trend of high suspended sediment yield in the range of the sicklefin redhorse sucker appears to have improved over the last few decades. Increasing environmental regulations, greater public awareness, and the actions of governmental and nongovernmental organizations to improve water quality conditions have resulted in significant improvements in suspended sediment rates. Therefore, we expect existing regulations for land development to adequately maintain habitat quality, and we anticipate that the species is likely to persist into the future even with the occurrence of some development.

The sicklefin redhorse sucker was provided additional protection by State statutes prohibiting its exploitation and association with other federally listed species. It is listed as threatened by the State of North Carolina and endangered by the State of Georgia. Both States prohibit direct take of the species and require a valid permit for scientific purposes without a valid State collecting permit. In the unimpounded portions of the mainstems of the Little Tennessee River and Tuckasegee River where the sicklefin redhorse sucker occurs, the species' habitat is indirectly protected by the Endangered Species Act, where the mainstem portions of both of these rivers are designated as critical habitat for the Appalachian elktoe (Alasmidonta raveneliana) [a mussel]. In addition to the Appalachian elktoe, the portion of the Little Tennessee River where the sicklefin redhorse sucker occurs also supports populations of the endangered purple varnish pearlymussel (Cummings fabula) and the threatened spotfin chub (Erimyzon monacha) and is also considered as critical habitat for the spotfin chub.

Substantial public land ownership in the watersheds occupied by the sicklefin redhorse sucker provides partial protection to the watershed. Approximately 43 percent of the land in the range of this species is owned by State and Federal agencies or by nongovernmental conservation organizations. On these conserved properties, land development is prohibited, providing protection to potentially important spawning water quality throughout the year. Most of the land surrounding Hiwassee and Fontana Lakes is publicly owned, which helps prevent erosion and protecting the near shore habitat used by juvenile sicklefin redhorse suckers. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has management jurisdiction over a portion of the lands within both the Hiwassee River and Tuckasegee River watersheds, and tribal water quality ordinances protect habitat and water quality in approximately 10 percent of the occupied area of the Little Tennessee River is protected from development by inclusion in the Nantahala National Forest. Almost the other three major spawning tributaries, most of the land is privately held and does have some impact on land development.

When the sicklefin redhorse sucker was considered a candidate status in 2005, the blueback herring, an invasive predator species, had been inadvertently introduced into Hiwassee Reservoir, a major waterbody supporting the sicklefin redhorse sucker. At the time, predation of young sicklefin redhorse suckers by blueback herring was an unassessed threat. However, a recent study examining the gut contents of blueback herring collected from Hiwassee Reservoir failed to find any sicklefin redhorse suckers among the prey items. The sicklefin redhorse sucker may naturally avoid predation by blueback herring by spawning in upstream sites typical spawning habitat for blueback herring. In the spring of 2016, blueback herring were collected from Fontana Reservoir, suggesting that blueback herring may negatively affect sicklefin redhorse sucker recruitment. Further investigation is required to determine if the distance between the presence of blueback herring in Fontana Reservoir affects the sicklefin redhorse sucker, but the distance to spawning sites upstream of Fontana Reservoir is similar to the distance in the Hiwassee Reservoir, suggesting that blueback herring may not be able to migrate from the hatching sicklefin redhorse sucker fry during the time when they are most likely to be vulnerable to predation. Collections in the Hiwassee River system in 2014â€“2015 produced many young adult/juvenile sicklefin redhorse suckers that have likely recruited since the herring invasion, even while juvenile walleye and white bass have been collected years after the invasion, suggesting the blueback herring is not preventing successful recruitment of young sicklefin redhorse suckers. Therefore, recent observations indicate that blueback herring have not proven to be a threat to the sicklefin redhorse sucker at any life stage.

Many of the stressors that may affect the sicklefin redhorse sucker in the future can be addressed through conservation actions carried out under the recently signed CCA among the Service, North Carolina Wildlife
