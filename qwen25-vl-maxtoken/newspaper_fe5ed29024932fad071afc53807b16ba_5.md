stability positively impacts small and large raisins by allowing them to better anticipate the revenues their raisins will generate.

There are some reporting, recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements under the order. The reporting and recordkeeping burdens are necessary for compliance purposes and for developing statistical reports for maintenance of the program. The requirements are the same as those applied in past years. Thus, this action imposes no additional reporting or recordkeeping burdens on either small or large entities. The forms require information which is readily available from handler records and which can be provided without data processing equipment or specialized statistical staff. The information collection and recordkeeping requirements have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB Control No. 0581-0229. As with other marketing order programs, reports and forms are periodically studied to reduce or eliminate duplicative information collection burdens by industry and public sector agencies. In addition, USDA has not identified any relevant Federal rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this rule.

Further, Committee and subcommittee meetings are widely publicized in advance and are held in a location central to the production area. The meetings are open to all industry members, including small business entities, and other interested persons who are encouraged to participate in the deliberations and voice their opinions on topics under discussion.

An interim final rule reporting this action was published in the Federal Register on April 22, 2004 (69 FR 21695). Copies of the rule were mailed to all handlers, grower alternates, the Raisin Bargaining Association, handlers, and dehydrators. In addition, the rule was made available through the website of the Office of the Federal Register and USDA. That rule provided for a 60-day comment period that ended June 21, 2004. No comments were received.

Any questions about the compliance guide should be sent to Joy Guerber at the previously mentioned FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT address.

After consideration of all relevant material presented, including the information and recommendation submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

[Docket No. 04–20]

RIN 1557–AC11

Fundamental Change in Asset Composition of a Bank

AGENCY: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule.

SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is amending its regulations to require a national bank to obtain the approval of the OCC before changing the composition of all, or substantially all, of its assets through sales or other dispositions, or (2) after having sold or disposed of all, or substantially all, of its assets, through acquisitions or other expansions of its operations. The final rule provides that, in each case, the OCC will apply, among other factors, the same factors as it applies to the establishment of a de novo bank. This new application process will enable the OCC to better assess the bank’s compliance with applicable law, whether the proposed change conforms with safe and sound banking practices.

DATES: Effective Date: October 1, 2004.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For questions concerning the final rule, contact Heidi M. Thomas, Special Counsel, Legislative and Regulatory Activities Division, [202] 874–5096; Richard Cleva, Senior Counsel, Bank Activities and Structure Division, at [202] 874– 5080; or John W. Stoeckel, Licensing Expert, Licensing Activities, at [202] 874–5060, 250 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20219.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

### I. Introduction

The OCC’s current regulations at 12 CFR part 5 do not require the approval of the OCC before a national bank significantly changes the composition of its assets through sale or other disposition, nor do they require prior OCC review or approval before a national bank that becomes a “stripped” or “dormant” bank charter. Likewise, our regulations do not address a dormant bank that increases its asset size through purchases or acquisitions to engage again in the business of banking. On March 7, 2004, we proposed to add to our regulations a prior approval requirement for these fundamental changes in a bank’s asset composition in order to address the supervisory concerns raised by these types of transactions. See 69 FR 892 (Jan. 7, 2004).

As described in the preamble to the proposed rule, these concerns may include increased operational risk, increased concentration risk (especially where asset composition changes as a result of a single transaction), lack of bank management to implement the new strategy successfully. In addition, a dormant bank being revived may propose to undertake activities that significantly deviate or are a change from the bank’s original business plan or may pursue activities poorly planned, or inadequately executed. These new activities can expose the bank to risks that it is not prepared for, with the potential for adverse consequences for the bank’s financial condition and, in the extreme situation, for its viability. Even though it is likely the case that traditional national banks may present elevated levels of risk to a particular community if the bank changes substantially or too quickly from a dominant status, misjudges its markets, or if its systems of risk management and internal control systems keep pace with the change. The preamble to the proposal also noted that concerns raised when a dormant or stripped bank by a third party necessitates the need for the OCC to thoroughly review the nature of the proposed product and might be initiated by an acquiring entity.

For the reasons discussed in this preamble, we are adopting in final form
