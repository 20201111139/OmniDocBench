Workshop Objectives

The Protected Species Safe Handling, Identification, and Reporting workshops are designed to teach longline and gillnet fishermen the required techniques for safe handling and release of entangled and/or hooked protected species, such as sea turtles, marine mammals, and smalltooth sawfish. In addition to safe release reporting, the proper identification of protected species will also be taught at these workshops. Fishermen and individuals attending these workshops will gain a better understanding of the regulations and the need for accurate reporting. The workshops will provide participants with the skills needed to reduce the mortality of protected species, which may prevent additional regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title of Collection: CFPB’s Consumer Complaint Intake System Company Portal Receiving and Response Collection System.

OMB Control Number: 3170–XXXX.

Type of Review: New collection.

(Request for a new OMB control number.)

Affected Public: Private sector.

Estimated Number of Respondents: 50,000.

Estimated Total Annual Burden Hours: 12,500.

Abstract: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Public Law 111–203, Title X, provides for the Bureau’s consumer complaint handling function. Among other things, it authorizes the Bureau to receive, centralized collection of, monitoring of, and responses to complaints concerning consumer financial products and services. The proposed information collection will allow companies to proactively participate in the Bureau’s Company Portal (Company Portal), a secure, Web-based interface between the Bureau’s Office of Consumer Response (Consumer Response) and companies. The Company Portal allows companies to view and respond to complaints submitted through the Bureau’s consumer complaint handling system. Many companies have sought to register with the Company Portal because they believe companies that have already submitted to the Bureau about their companies to ensure early notice of potential complaints and similar issues, and to provide access to the software and security protocols needed to access the Company Portal. The Bureau’s proposed form, the Board of Directors Report Form (Boarding Form), will streamline information collection from these companies and lead to a greatly enhanced and efficient experience from both the consumers and companies’ perspectives.

Request for Comments: Comments are invited on: (a) Whether the collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the Bureau, including whether the information will have practical utility; (b) The accuracy of the Bureau’s estimate of the burden of the collection of information, including the validity of the methodology and the assumptions used; (c) Ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected; and (d) Ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval. All comments will become a matter of public record.

Dated: November 19, 2014.
