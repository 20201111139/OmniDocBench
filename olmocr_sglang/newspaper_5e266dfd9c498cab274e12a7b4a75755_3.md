Terms and Conditions: FLPMA Section 209, 43 U.S.C. 1719(a), states that “all conveyances of title issued by the Secretary...shall reserve to the United States all minerals in the lands.” The patents, when issued, will contain a mineral reservation to the United States for all minerals.

In response to requests to clarify this mineral reservation as it relates to mineral materials, such as sand and gravel, we refer interested parties to the regulations at 43 CFR 3601.71(b), which provides that the owner of the surface estate of lands with reserved Federal minerals may “use a minimal amount of mineral materials for ‘personal use’ within the boundaries of the surface estate without a sales contract or permit.
