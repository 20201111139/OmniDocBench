contents of Mn and Si, which is consistent with the literature. After being SHTed for 8 hours, almost the entire amount of Al₂Cu is dissolved into the Al matrix as shown in Figure 2(b). It is also interesting to note that the Chinese script α-Fe phase becomes unstable and is transformed into a small amount of short intermetallic platelets, leading to the fragmentation of the α-Fe.

The chemical compositions of the iron-rich intermetallics in Alloy B in the as-cast and SHTed (for 8 hours) conditions measured by SEM-EDS are shown in Table II. It can be found that higher Al contents are detected in the α-Fe and Sted β-Fe after SHT than the corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from the liquid. This can be attributed to the partial contribution of the surrounding Al matrix due to the small sizes of the fragmented α-Fe and Sted β-Fe particles after SHT. Compared with the as-cast condition, it can be found that the iron content in α-Fe is reduced after SHT for 8 hours. As shown in Figure 2(c), however, the EBSD results with a mean angular deviation (MAD) of 0.452, lower than 0.7 which is considered to be critical for an accurate solution, indicate that this phase is still the α-Fe (body-centered cubic with a, b, and c as 1.265 nm). Moreover, the platelet-like intermetallic phase formed during the SHT has a similar chemical composition to the β-Fe obtained in the as-cast condition (Table II) and thus is termed as solid-state-transformed β-Fe (Sted β-Fe) to distinguish it from the β-Fe directly precipitated from liquid metal during solidification. The formation of the Sted β-Fe is further confirmed a low MAD value of 0.258 as measured by EBSD (Figure 2(d)). The Sted β-Fe is most likely to have the same crystal structure as the solidified β-Fe (tetragonal with a and b of 0.634 nm and c of 1.488 nm) due to their similar diffraction patterns. However, the Sted β-Fe has lower Cu content than the β-Fe (Table II), and the replacement of the Cu by Al
