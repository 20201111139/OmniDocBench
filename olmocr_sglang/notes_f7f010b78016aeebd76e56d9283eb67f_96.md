三、根据情景和逻辑进行判断

As they go around town, the police help people. Sometimes they find lost children. They take the children home. If the police see a fight, they put an end to it right away. Sometimes people will ask the police how to get to a place in town. The police can always tell the people which way to go. They know all the streets and roads well.

In the text, "put an end to" mean "——".
A. stop  B. cut  C. kill  D. fly

根据文章提供的情景，如果警察看到有人在打架，他们会去制止。因为制止打架是警察的职责。选A。

三、根据并列或同位关系猜测词义

There is a place on our earth where hot water and steam come up under the ground. It is on a large island in the Pacific Ocean. The island is North Island in New Zealand.

What does the word "steam" mean in Chinese?
A. 自来水  B. 大气  C. 水蒸  D. 燃气

从语法上看，steam 和 hot water 是并列关系，所以选项 B 和 C 相关，是同一种物质，在所给第四个选项中只有“蒸汽”有这种可能。
