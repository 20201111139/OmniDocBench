Overview of This Information Collection

(1) Type of Information Collection Request: Revision of a Currently Approved Collection. This is a change from the 60-day Federal Register Notice published at 77 FR 38307. That notice was an Extension, Without Change, of a Currently Approved Collection. The collection has been revised as a result of changes required since the 60 day notice was published that increased the time required to complete this benefit request.

(2) Title of the Form/Collection: Refugee/Asylee Relative Petition.
(3) Agency form number, if any, and the applicable component of the DHS sponsoring the collection: 1–730; USCIS.
(4) Affected public who will be asked or required to respond, as well as a brief abstract: Primary: Individuals or households. Form I–730 will be used by an asylee or refugee to file on behalf of his or her spouse and/or children for follow-to-join benefits provided that the relationship to the refugee/asylee existed prior to their admission to the United States.

(5) An estimate of the total number of respondents and the amount of time estimated for an average respondent to respond: 86,400 respondents with an estimated burden per response of .667 hours (40 minutes). This is a change from the estimated burden per response reported on the 60-day Federal Register Notice published at 77 FR 38307. The 60-day notice estimated that the 86,400 respondents would require an estimated burden per response of .583 hours (35 minutes).

(6) An estimate of the total public burden (in hours) associated with the collection: 57,600 Hours. This is a change from the estimated total public burden hours reported at 77 FR 38307, which estimated the total burden associated with this collection to be 50,371 hours.
