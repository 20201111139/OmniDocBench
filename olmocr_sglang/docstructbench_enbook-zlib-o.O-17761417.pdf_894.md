ETIOLOGY

Injury to a peripheral nerve can occur by means of several mechanisms: stretching, compression (i.e., sustained compression or blunt trauma), friction, inflammation, or laceration. The clinical results of stretching or compression of the nerve vary depending on whether the insult has a rapid onset or is the result of a gradual change. A sudden insult does not allow for any adaptive change in the connective tissue of the nerve and is more likely to cause acute disruption of the nerve’s blood supply or connective tissue. Conversely, the nerve can adapt surprisingly well to a slow increase in tensile or compressive forces, such as that brought on by a growing osteophyte. A classification of peripheral nerve injuries is presented in Table 25-1,13-16

| TABLE 25-1 |
| Classification of Nerve Injuries13-16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Type** | **Seddon’s Classification** | **Sunderland’s Classification** | **Pathological Basis** | **Possible Causes** | **Prognosis** |
| Neurapraxia | Focal conduction block | Local myelin injury, primarily larger fibers | Electrolyte imbalances | Recovery within minutes, hours, or days if lesion was caused by anoxia or ionic imbalances | Mechanical compression or stretch may recover in weeks to months |
| | Primarily motor function and proprioception are affected | Axonal continuity | Deformation of myelin sheaths | | |
| | Some sensation and sympathetic function possibly present | No Wallerian degeneration | Ischemia caused by compression or traction | | |
| Axonotmesis | Type 2: | Loss of axonal continuity with Wallerian degeneration | Compression | Axonal regeneration required for recovery | |
| | Loss of nerve conduction at injury site and distally | Connective tissue elements of the nerve remain intact | The length of time for regeneration will depend on the distance of the injury from the end of the nerve | Good prognosis | |
| Type 3: | Loss of axonal continuity and endoneurial tubes | Compression | Disruption of endoneurial tubes, hemorrhage, and edema, producing scarring | Axonal misdirection possible | |
| | Perineurium and epineurium preserved | | Poor prognosis | Surgery possibly required | |
| Type 4: | Loss of nerve conduction at injury site and distally | Damage to endoneurium and perineurium | Compression | Intraneural scarring and axonal misdirection | |
| | Epineurium remains intact | | Poor prognosis | Surgery required | |
| Neurotmesis | Type 5: | Severance of entire nerve | Compression | Surgical resection and repair only means of recovery; full recovery unlikely | |
| | Loss of nerve conduction at injury site and distally | Traction | Factors that affect extent of recovery: nerve injured, level at which nerve is damaged, extent of injury, time elapsed since injury, patient’s age | Laceration | |
