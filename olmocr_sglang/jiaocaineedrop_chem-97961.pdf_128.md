**Video 5.1.2:** A science experiment in the kitchen shows what happens to sugar molecules when they are heated. The experiment did not disappoint!

As with salt, sugar has radically different properties (both physical and chemical) than its constituent elements. This difference in properties, of constituent elements and compounds, is a central feature of chemical reactions.
