The gene expression alterations listed in Table I from the five different arrays used, have been grouped into four separate groups based on the function of the genes involved. As IL-8 (29) and IκB (30) have previously been suggested to be transcriptional

This table contains a list of genes whose expression was consistently altered after exposure to DCA. By consistent, we mean that the expression change was evident on both duplicate array experiments (although no real-time PCR data available). In the right hand column is the time point at which the expression change was evident. The arrows in the central column reflect the relative strength of the expression changes.

**DCA specifically switches on IκB and IL-8**

RNA extracted from untreated OE33 cells and OE33 cells treated for 24 h with 300 μM DCA at pH 7, was analysed using five different pathway specific membrane arrays. By far the most prominent of the DCA induced gene expression changes were the switching on of IκB and IL-8. As IκB and IL-8 are transcriptional targets of NF-κB, this suggests activation of NF-κB by DCA (as is demonstrated below). As shown in Figure 2, using a cancer pathway array and a signal transduction array, both IκB and IL-8 are substantially up-regulated 24 h after DCA treatment. Figure 2 also shows a number of other changes in gene expression 24 h after DCA treatment (mostly up-regulation), these (and other changes noted from other arrays) are documented in Table I.

**Fig. 2.** Membrane array analysis of DCA treated OE33 cells, 24 h post-exposure. (a) Cancer pathway arrays were used to study gene expression abnormalities induced by 300 μM DCA relative to untreated OE33 cells. These example arrays show the up-regulation of the IκB and IL-8 genes by DCA. (b) Two example signal transduction arrays are shown; those hybridized with cDNA from untreated OE33 cells and cDNA from OE33 cells 24 h after DCA exposure. A number of other genes are up-regulated by DCA, particularly evident in the cancer pathway array in (a). These genes (and others) are identified in Table I.
