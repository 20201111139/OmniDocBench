Great changes in my hometown

More than twenty years ago, my hometown was just a small, old and poor town. Most of people were farmers. There were few factories. The people didn't have enough food to eat and wore old clothes. They had a hard life.

Great changes have taken place in the past twenty years. The people have found a lot of ways of making money. Now there are many tall buildings. They are very beautiful. Roads are wide and clean. People can take buses or drive their town cars to go to work. Many people have cell phones and personal computers. People's living conditions have improved a lot. Thanks to the government's efforts, my hometown is becoming more and more beautiful.
