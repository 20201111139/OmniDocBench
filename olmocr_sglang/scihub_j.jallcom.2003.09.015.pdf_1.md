$^a$ Compounds were found only in the as-cast samples.
$^b$ Data of our investigation.

The formation of solid solution regions for the binary compounds was not revealed, and practically no variation of the lattice parameters of the ternary borides in two- and three-phase samples was observed (Table 2). This fact indicates that no homogeneity ranges exist for the ternary compounds.

The ternary compounds Ln$_2$NiB$_{10}$ where Ln = Y, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho with the Th$_2$NiB$_{10}$ structure type were reported in [12]. We prepared the sample of the composition Er$_2$NiB$_{10}$ to verify the formation of the boride with the same structure in the Er–Ni–B system. But the powder diffraction pattern of this sample contained the lines of three binary compounds (ErB$_4$ + ErB$_{12}$ + NiB), which indicates the absence of the ternary boride Er$_2$NiB$_{10}$ in the Er–Ni–B system (Table 2).

A compound of the composition ErNiB$_4$ was reported to crystallize with two different structures: ErNiB$_4$ [13] and YCrB$_4$ [14]. This can indicate the existence of polymorphism for this boride. Taking into account that the boride with the ErNiB$_4$ type structure was found by a single-crystal method, and that the boride with the YCrB$_4$ type structure was found by X-ray powder diffraction, we assumed the high-temperature modification to have the ErNiB$_4$ structure and the low-temperature modification to have the YCrB$_4$ structure. The results of a DTA investigation revealed a transition temperature of 1540 K.

A new compound of the approximate composition ErNi$_3$B$_2$ with unknown structure was found. The X-ray powder pattern of this compound differed from the powder patterns of the known ternary borides found in the earlier studied Ln–Ni–B systems. This compound exists only in the as-cast sample and decomposes into the Er$_2$Ni$_3$B$_6$ and ErNi$_4$B compounds after annealing. Since the single crystals were not available its structure was not determined.

A further new compound was found in the as-cast samples containing 16.6 at% Er. The X-ray powder pattern of this compound was very similar to the powder pattern of the ErNi$_2$B$_4$ boride. The crystal structure of the new Er$_{0.917}$Ni$_{4.09}$B boride was determined using an X-ray single-crystal method: space group P6$_3$mm; a = 1.48399 nm; c = 0.69194 nm [15]. This structure is very similar to the Y$_{0.915}$Ni$_{12.32}$B structure [16]. The Er$_{0.917}$Ni$_{4.09}$B boride decomposes after annealing, and the main phase is the ErNi$_3$B$_2$ compound.

According to our data, the ErNi$_2$B$_{10}$ boride has the correct composition ErNi$_3$B$_3$: space group I4$_1$/amd; a =
