20.2 Defect Amplification and Removal

- Defect Amplification Model

| Defects                                      | Detection                           |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Errors passed through                       | Errors passed through               |
| Amplified errors 1:x                        | Percent Efficiency                  |
| Newly generated errors                      | Errors passed To next step           |

Development step

- Assume that an error uncovered during **design** will cost 1.5 monetary unit to correct. Relative to this cost, the same error uncovered just **before testing** commences will cost 6.5 units; **during testing**, 15 units; and **after release**, between 67 and 100 units.

- A number of studies indicate that **design activities** introduce between 50% - 65% of all errors during the software process. However, **formal review technique** have been shown to be up to 75% effective in uncovering design flaws.
