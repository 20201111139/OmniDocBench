# FUNCTIONAL GROUPS IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

Functional groups are the characteristic groups of organic molecules that give them their reactivity: In the formulae below, R represents the rest of the molecule and X represents any halogen atom.

|Hydrocarbons|Halogen-containing groups|Oxygen-containing groups|Nitrogen-containing groups|Sulfur-containing groups|Phosphorus-containing groups|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|ALKANE|HALOALKANE|ALCOHOL|AMINE|THIOL| |
|ALKENE| |ALDEHYDE|AMIDE|SULFIDE| |
|ALKYNE| |KETONE|NITRITE|DISULFIDE| |
|ARENE| |CARBOXYLIC ACID|NITRILE| | |
| |ACID ANHYDRIDE|ESTER|ETHER|SULFOXIDE| |
| |ACYL HALIDE|Epoxide|SULFONE|SULFONIC ACID| |
| | |SULFINIC ACID|SULFONATE ESTER|THIOCYANATE| |
| | |ISOTHIOCYANATE|THIOKETONE|PHOSPHINE| |
