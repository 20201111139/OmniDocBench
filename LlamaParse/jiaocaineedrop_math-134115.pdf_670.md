         In 1859,an Australian landowner named Thomas Austin released 24 rabbits into the wild for hunting: Because Australia had few
         predators and ample food, the rabbit population exploded. In fewer than ten years, the rabbit population numbered in the millions_

      from those exponential functions can be solved to analyze and make predictions about exponential growth: In this section, we will
          learn techniques for solving exponential functions_
          Using Like Bases to Solve Exponential Equations
The first technique involves two functions with like bases. Recall that the one-to-one property of exponential functions tells us that;
         for any real numbers b, S,and T, where b > 0,b +1,65 = bT if and only if S =T
             In other words, when an exponential equation has the same base oneach side; the exponents must be equal. This also applies
        when the exponents are algebraic expressions Therefore; we can solve many exponential equations by using the rules of exponents
         to rewrite each side as a power with the same base. Then, we use the fact that exponential functions are one-tO-one t0 set the
         exponents equal to one another; and solve for the unknown:
          For example, consider the equation 34r-7        To solve for €, we usethe division property of exponents to rewrite the right
           side so that both sides have the common base, 3. Then we apply the one-to-one property of exponents by setting the exponents
         equal to one another and solving for €:
                                   341-7    321
                                   34r-7    321            Rewrite 3 as 31
                                   34r-7   321-1           Use the division property of exponents
                                   4x - 7  2 -1            Apply the one-to-one property of exponents
                                       21                  Subtract 2x and add   to both sides
                                         =3                Divide by 3
