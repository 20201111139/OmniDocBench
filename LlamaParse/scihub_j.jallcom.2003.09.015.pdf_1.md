Compounds were found only in the as-cast samples.

Data of our investigation: The formation of solid solution regions for the binary compounds was not revealed, and practically no variation of the lattice parameters of the ternary borides in two- and three-phase samples was observed (Table 2). This fact indicates that no homogeneity ranges exist for the ternary compounds.

The ternary compounds LnzNiB1o where Ln-Y Gd, Tb Dy; Ho with the Th2NiB[0 structure type were reported in [12]. We prepared the sample of the composition ErzNiB1o to verify the formation of the boride with the same structure in the Er-Ni-B system: But the powder diffraction pattern of this sample contained the lines of three binary compounds (ErB4 + ErB12 + NiB), which indicates the absence of the ternary boride Er_NiB,o in the Er-Ni-B system (Table 2).

The compound of the composition ErNiB4 was reported to crystallize with two different structures: ErNiB4 [13] and YCrB4 [14]. This can indicate the existence of polymorphism for this boride. Taking into account that the boride with the ErNiB4 type structure was found by a single-crystal method, and that the boride with the YCrB4 type structure was found by X-ray powder diffraction; we assumed the high-temperature modification to have the ErNiB4 structure and the low-temperature modification to have the YCrB4 structure: The results of a DTA investigation revealed a transition temperature of 1540 K.

A new compound of the approximate composition ErNisBz with unknown structure was found: The X-ray powder pattern of this compound differed from the powder patterns of the known ternary borides found in the earlier studied Ln-Ni-B systems. This compound exists only in the as-cast sample and decomposes into the ErzNizhBo and ErNi4B compounds after annealing: Since the single crystals were not available its structure was not determined.

Further, a compound found in the as-cast samples containing 16.6 at.% Er: The X-ray powder pattern of this compound was very similar to the powder pattern of the ErNi4B boride. The crystal structure of the Ero.917Ni4 boride was determined using an X-ray single-crystal method: space group Polmmm; 1.48399 nm; 0.69194 nm [15]. This structure is very similar to the Yo.917Ni4.I2B structure [16]. The ErO.917Ni4.O9B boride decomposes after annealing; and the main phase is the ErNi4B compound.

According to our data, the Er4Ni29B10 boride has the composition ErNiqBz: space group [4plamd;
