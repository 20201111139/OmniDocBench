233 % 5 Pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure test

Rank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal administration of AEDs in the pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital rufinamide valproate ethosuximide > > phenytoin (Table 9). Phenytoin was ineffective up to a dose of 300 mg/kg. In slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant potency in this test with oral administration in mice was phenobarbital rufinamide ethosuximide > > valproate > > phenytoin (Table 2).

Oral rufinamide (21,000 mg/kg) and phenytoin (800 mg/kg) did not inhibit pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticonvulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.

# Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced seizure tests in mice

Intraperitoneal rufinamide was effective at nontoxic doses in the bicuculline and picrotoxin clonic seizure tests (ED50 ~50-75 mg/kg) and showed partial protection from strychnine-induced tonic seizures (37.59 protection; Table 1). Overall, the general order of potency in these chemically induced seizure tests was phenobarbital > rufinamide > valproate > ethosuximide > phenytoin (Table 1). In the strychnine-induced tonic seizure test, phenytoin had the lowest ED50 value, suggesting the greatest potency. However, it is important to note that 50% protection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Phenytoin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice.

# Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice

The median toxic dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide (TD50) in the rotorod test of behavioral impairment was 500-1,000 mg/kg. The TD50 for rufinamide was higher than that for comparator AEDs (Table 1), indicating lower toxicity. Higher doses of rufinamide were not assessed due to the low ED50 values and high protective index (>40).

Neurological side effects of very high-dose intraperitoneal rufinamide (1,000 mg/kg; ED50 15-100 mg/kg) included decreased motor activity, ataxia, muscle relaxation, decreased respiration, and death (one animal died; the other appeared normal). Higher doses of the comparator drugs induced increased side effects (2 TD50) and resulted in death (all animals) in 3-24 h (4 x TD50).

The safety ratio for rufinamide in mice (TD3/ED9 >19.2 [intraperitoneal] and >23.8 [oral]) was consistently greater than for phenytoin, phenobarbital, and valproate (Table 4).

The median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required to produce loss of righting reflex in mice (HD50) was 7500 and < 1,000 mg/kg (Table 5). Rufinamide had a nu-

Rufinamide, ethosuximide, and valproate had comparable.
