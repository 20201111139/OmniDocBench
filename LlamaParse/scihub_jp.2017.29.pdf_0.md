# OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this study is to assess and modify an existing decision aid and field-test decision coaching with the modified aid during consultations with parents facing potential delivery at 23 to 24 weeks gestation.

# STUDY DESIGN:

International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument (IPDASi) scoring deficits, multi-stakeholder group feedback and testing guided modifications. Feasibility/acceptability were assessed. The Decisional Conflict Scale was used to measure participants' decisional conflict before (T1) and immediately after (T2) the consultation.

# RESULTS:

IPDASi assessment of the existing aid (score 1/35) indicated it required updated data, more information and a palliative care description. Following modification, IPDASi score increased to 26/35. Twenty subjects (12 pregnancies) participated in field-testing; 15 completed all questionnaires. Most participants (89%) would definitely recommend this form of consultation. Decisional conflict scores decreased (P < 0.001) between T1 (52 ± 25) and T2 (10 ± 16).

# CONCLUSION:

Field testing demonstrated that consultations using the aid with decision coaching were feasible, reduced decisional conflict and may facilitate shared decision-making.

# INTRODUCTION

Given continued parental dissatisfaction and healthcare professionals' difficulties with consultations at the limit of viability, the objectives of this study were to: (1) assess and, if necessary, modify an existing PtDA for use in our institution and (2) field-test decision coaching with the PtDA with parents facing potential delivery at 23 or 24 weeks GA to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using PtDA in this situation and determine the effect on parental decisional conflict.

In clinical settings, patient decision aids (PtDA) can facilitate shared decision-making (SDM). They support the participation of patients in decision making about health care options by improving patient knowledge, involvement and values-choice agreement. Decision coaching, where trained coaches provide patients with individualized, non-directive guidance, is often used in conjunction with PtDA and has similar benefits.

When facing the potential delivery of an extremely premature infant at 23 to 24 weeks gestational age (GA), parents often face the choice of having the healthcare team provide either intensive or palliative care for their infant. Although evidence strongly supports the use of PtDA and decision coaching to support patients in decision-making, minimal evidence exists regarding their use with parents making life or death decisions for their unborn infant.

Four authors (GM, S Ding, Dunn and TD) performed independent assessments of the existing PtDA using the International Patient Decision Aid Standards instrument (IPDASi, v4.0) that provides a framework to certify decision support tools through evaluating and improving their content, development and implementation. Nine of the 44 IPDASi items were not applied as the PtDA did not involve screening tests. A PtDA must receive 'yes' for all qualifying criteria to be considered PtDA, scoring greater than three on all certification criteria for IPDAS certification and quality items indicate better PtDA quality. Scoring differences were discussed until consensus was achieved. Unmet criteria allowed identification of the existing PtDA's shortcomings.

To complement the assessment, an existing multi-stakeholder working group (that included parents of extremely premature infants) completed a survey to rank health-related factors important to the decision that could influence the use of the PtDA.
