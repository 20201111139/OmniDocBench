Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier survival plots of the midterm survival according to the weight mismatch tertile group on the condition of discharge from hospital. The plots were not significantly different, log-rank p 0.136.

Figure 1: Kaplan-Meier survival plots of the overall actuarial survival according to the weight mismatch tertile group, from the time of operation to final follow-up. There was reduced survival among those in the lowest tertile group, log-rank p= 0.04.

The mean period of ventilation post transplant was 302.7 h (SD 617.8, median 102 h (IQR 298). On Spearman's rank correlation, this was not associated with the donor/recipient weight ratio (Fig: 3) (p =-0.12, p = 0.14). Even when excluding the 11 patients who had been intubated for more than 100 h, there was no association (p = 0.10, p = 0.38) (Fig: 4).

The mean period of ITU stay was 448 h (SD 749.2), median 184 h (IQR 374). On Spearman's rank correlation, this was also not related to the weight ratio (p = 0.04, p = 0.58) (Fig: 5). Again, if the six patients who were in the ITU for more than 2000 h were excluded, there was still no association (p < 0.01, p = 0.98).

# Extreme mismatch subgroup

# Secondary outcome measures

Data on postoperative RV function was available in 158 out of 161 patients. Thirty-eight patients (24%) developed RV failure. In the lower tertile group; 18.9% developed postoperative RV failure, in the middle group 24.5% and in the upper tertile group 28.8%; this was not statistically different (p = 0.48) (Table 3).

At the end of the follow-up period, of the six patients with extreme mismatch who had been investigated with ambulatory blood pressure measurement; only one was being treated for hypertension.
