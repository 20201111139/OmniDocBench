# Summary

Epidemiological studies have suggested that many rare diseases with respiratory involvement have genetic component. Molecular advances have increased the understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases which has led to better diagnostic and prognostic methods. There may be many genes responsible for diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia and systemic lupus erythematosus in addition to the effect of modifier genes. The genotype phenotype correlation in these diseases remains to be elucidated. In some diseases, such as familial dysautonomia and sickle cell, the gene has been identified which allows for accurate pre-natal testing. Further, in diseases where the genetic abnormality is known, such as chronic granulomatous disease, gene therapy remains a realistic prospect and phase studies are about to commence or currently underway. This article reviews those rare diseases in which there is or is likely to be significant genetic contribution.

# INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years there have been great advances in molecular technology: This has enabled further understanding of the molecular pathophysiology and causation of many diseases and the interaction between the host and the environment that influences expression (Fig: those diseases in which the environment cannot be manipulated, the ultimate hope is to identify and correct the molecular defects or manipulate them in an attempt to overcome the abnormalities they cause. This article examines the genetic contribution in rare diseases that have pulmonary involvement and in which there has been significant genetic contribution with the potential for future gene therapy.

Current attempts at therapeutic measures include overcoming the abnormalities caused by the gene or introducing functioning gene through gene therapy: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the paradigm for gene therapy in respiratory disease. Since the gene was localised more than 100 patients have received the gene in CF clinical trials.
