Thus constraint of 3 mol % is defined for the maximum amount of reactants leaving the column from the top. The liquid action in the reactive trays are selected as 2000 mols to have reasonable liquid height: The composition of FAo is 50 mol % A and 50 mol % I. Kinetic parameters of the ternary are given in Table 5.

The basic design system literature procedure is based on the existing paper in the optimization problem for the ternary system with inert includes five design variables. These are the number of stripping trays Ns, the number of reactive trays NRX and the number of rectifying trays Np, the column pressure P, and the reflux R. The objective function is TAC, and the same basis of economics is used as that has been used for the ternary system without inert component.

The results of this ternary system differ significantly from those of the quaternary systems in terms of the actions of temperature controllers. The studies on quaternary systems concluded that the two temperature controllers had to have the same action. However, dynamically stable results are obtained for this ternary system with temperature controllers having opposite actions: Details of the physical explanation of this situation are given in a recent paper.

# 3.2. Ternary System with Inert Component

The flowsheet of ternary system with inert is given in Figure 9. This system involves four components. However, one of them is an inert component in terms of the reaction. Since its volatility is assumed the same as that of the fresh feed stream FAo as light reactant A, it is fed from the mixture with A. The other fresh feed stream FBo contains pure reactant B. While the heavy product leaves the column from the bottom, the low-inert is removed from the distillate without taking part in the reaction. Thus, the column has three zones: stripping section, reactive zone, and rectifying section. It is assumed that the light and heavy fresh feed streams are fed from the bottom and top trays of the reactive zone respectively.

The main design objective is to obtain the purity of the product at 98 mol % C. On the other hand, the amount of reactants escaping from the distillate stream should also be considered: This is especially important for the light reactant A, which has an identical volatility with the inert component I. The decrease of the value of 0390 moderates the sharpness of the temperature profile. The size of the hump in the reactive zone also increases as the value of 0390 decreases.
