The calzone golem is a strange construct dreamed up by Andolyn and Gendrew and created through a delicate process that mixes alchemy and bakery in ways never before imagined by mortal beings. It looks like a doughy humanoid, and smells of cheese and tomatoes.

# Combat

As a golem, the calzone golem is incapable of strategy and tactics. Its creator can command it if within 60 feet. When not directly controlled, most calzone golems stand as steadfast guardians of kitchens, pantries, and dining halls.

# Breath Weapon (Su)

Once every 5 rounds, the calzone golem can exhale a cloud of nauseating gas as a free action. This is identical to a stinking cloud spell.

# Heat (Ex)

The calzone generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage.

# Berserk (Ex)

When a calzone golem is struck by a slashing or piercing weapon, it must make a Will save (DC 12), or its elemental spirit breaks free and goes berserk: The uncontrolled golem begins rampaging, attacking the nearest living creature or smashing some object smaller than itself if no creature is within reach; then moving on to more destruction. Once the golem goes berserk, no known method can reestablish control.

# Magic Immunity (Ex)

Calzone golems are immune to all spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural effects, except as follows: Cold-based effects slow them (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds with no saving throw. Fire-based damage hardens the golem, temporarily increasing its natural armor bonus by +1 for every 3 points of damage it would otherwise deal (this hardening fades after 1d4 hours). The golem rolls no saving throw against fire effects.

# Spurt (Ex)

If the calzone golem is struck for slashing or piercing damage, it spurts out a small splash of extremely hot juices from the wound. This spurt inflicts 1 point of fire damage to all individuals within 5 feet of the golem.

A calzone golem's body is created from a mixture of fine ingredients, including approximately 100 pounds of flour; 50 pounds of cheese; four gallons of tomato sauce; and large quantities of salt, yeast, and sugar. Mushrooms, olives, or other ingredients may be added to the tomato sauce as desired. Season with oregano and black pepper to taste. All ingredients must be fresh and of the highest quality. The cost to create the golem is 10,000 gp.

Assembling the body requires a successful Profession (cook) check (DC 15), along with baking at approximately 450 degrees for 2 hours. The creator must be 9th level and able to cast arcane spells. Completing the ritual drains 250 XP from the creator and requires burning hands, grease, major creation, and stinking cloud.
