the contract. Fifth will be changed to Rule 825(b) provides that the ex- dividend date for transactions in stock for which there exists a transfer facility in Philadelphia is the fourth business day preceding the record date. The reference to fourth business day will be changed to second business day. In the event the record date is not a business day; the ex-dividend date will be changed from the fifth preceding business day to the third preceding business day.

Rule 362 will require the contract price of bonds dealt in and interest made regular way delayed delivery to include interest computed only up to but not including the third business day rather than the fifth business day following the day of the contract. Rule 371(a) states that with delayed delivery contracts in bonds dealt in and interest made prior to the fifth business day preceding the interest payment date for delivery on or after the interest payment date, there will be a cash adjustment for coupons paid. The rule will be changed to prior to the third business day preceding the interest payment date. Similarly, Rule 371(b) will require that 'seller's option contracts in bonds dealt in and interest made prior to the third business day, instead of the fifth business day, preceding the interest payment date for delivery on or after the payment date will have a cash adjustment for coupons paid.

Rule 431 states that transactions (except those made for cash) shall be ex-dividend or ex-rights on the fourth business day preceding the record date. This will be changed to the second business day. With regard to a record date on other than a business day, the transaction shall be ex-dividend or ex-rights on the third preceding business day rather than on the fifth preceding business day. Rule 432 prescribes when ex-warrant trading will begin. The ex-warrant period will be changed from the fourth business day preceding the date of expiration of warrants to the second business day. When warrant expiration occurs on a day other than a business day, the ex-warrant period will be changed from the fifth business day preceding expiration date to third business day.

Rule 823 requires that all transactions effected on the PHLX will be settled pursuant to the "five day delivery plan" which requires regular way transactions to settle on the fifth business day after the transaction date. The proposed rule change will change all references from five to three.

Rule 823 also demonstrates the "five day delivery plan" by stating that a transaction that occurs on Monday will settle on the Monday of the following week: This language will be changed to be consistent with the "three day delivery plan."
