# Coupling of aldehyde, alkyne, and amine catalyzed by AuIRMOF-3 in 1,4-dioxane

Reaction conditions: aldehyde (0.250 mmol), amine (0.300 mmol), alkyne (0.325 mmol), catalyst (0.07 g), the reaction temperatures are 120, 150, and 150 °C on 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, 0.6%Au/IRMOF-3, and 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 catalysts, respectively. The reaction time was not optimized; GC yield or conversion based on aldehydes the product was determined by GC-MS.

With the catalyst of 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3, the reaction with secondary amines proceeded smoothly to afford the corresponding propargylamines. Among the various amines tested, alicyclic amines such as piperidine, pyrrolidine, and morpholine gave good conversions of benzaldehyde, whereas diethylamine afforded a lower conversion. This was reported to be highly affected by the nature of aldehydes, and the reactivity of aldehydes could be affected by the employed amines and benzaldehyde which are more stable than that generated from dialkyl amine and benzaldehyde.

Kidwai et al. found that aryl aldehydes possessing electron-withdrawing groups afforded better yield than those with an electron-donating group bound to the benzene ring which required longer reaction time with metallic Au nanoparticles as catalyst. Wei and Li reported that both aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes were able to undergo the corresponding coupling with the catalyst of AuBr. They found that electron-withdrawing groups displayed high reactivities; however, electron-rich groups bound to the benzene ring decreased the reactivity and required longer reaction time. The decreased yield for aliphatic aldehydes was caused by the trimerization of aliphatic alkynes, which was probably ascribed to the limitation effect of aldehydes with homogeneous gold salts.

Zhang and Corma found that benzaldehyde with electron-donating groups react smoothly; while substitution of electron-withdrawing groups on the benzene ring decreases the reactivity with the catalyst of Au/CeO2. Based on the above results we may presume that the activity difference could be due to the different properties (e.g., different oxidation states) between 4.6%Au/IRMOF-3 and 6%Au/IRMOF-3, 3.2%Au/IRMOF-3 catalysts.
