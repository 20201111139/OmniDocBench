# (18% On FA and Regular Languages)

Say whether each of the following languages is regular or not regular? Prove your answers:

1. L1 = { w | w ∈ {0,1}* and has an equal number of 0s and 1s }.
2. L2 = { w | w ∈ {0,1}* and w has an equal number of 0s and 1s }.

# (20%) On PDA and Context-Free Languages

Let L3 = { w c an bm | w ∈ {a,b}*, where w is regular and n, m < 2n }.

Give a context-free grammar for the language L2.

Design PDA M = (K, X, T, A, s, F) accepting the language L3:

# Solution:

The PDA M = (K, E, T, 4, s, F) is defined below:

|(4, 0, 8)|p, %|
|---|---|
|K = {|2 = {a, b, c}|
|T = {| |
|F = {| |
