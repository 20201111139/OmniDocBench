Different between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no hematoma; wound infection, reoperation; and chronic severe pain occurred in 10% of patients [5]. Minor complications such as dysesthesia and superficial infection occurred in 39% of patients [5]. In the current study, sensory disturbance around the iliac crest in eight patients (20%) and donor site pain in six patients (15%) were seen in the ICBG group 2 years after surgery.

# Discussion

Table 5 shows complications at final follow-up. There was deep infection (surgical site infection) in the local bone graft group. There was no other complication in the local bone graft group. However, sensory disturbance around the iliac crest in eight patients and donor site pain in six patients were found in the ICBG group. Some authors have reported the efficacy of instrumented posterolateral fusion using ICBG for degenerated spondylolisthesis when compared with decompression only or non-instrumented posterolateral fusion [2, 12]. Prospective studies evaluating fusion rate using instrumented posterolateral fusion with ICBG showed results from 82% to 95% [2, 12]. There has been one report comparing the clinical and radiologic outcome of instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion using local bone versus an autogenous ICBG using a retrospective comparative study [9]. Overall fusion rate was higher in the ICBG group (75%) compared with the local bone group (65%), but not significantly different [9]. In the current prospective randomized study, fusion rate using local bone graft and ICBG was consistent with the previous studies: Clinical results after surgery were not significantly different between the local bone and ICBG groups in the current study. However, surgical time was significantly shorter for the local bone graft group compared with the ICBG group. As seen in the retrospective comparison between the two groups [9], there was no significant difference overall clinical outcome between the two groups. However, blood loss and hospital stay were significantly less for the local bone group compared with the ICBG group.
