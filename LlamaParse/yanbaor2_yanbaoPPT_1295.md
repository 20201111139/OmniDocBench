# Section I: What do they want?

# Key takeaway 3:

Buying luxury is also a way to convey and enjoy a shared social experience.

Indeed, the concept of a niche brand has multiple meanings across luxury lifestyle segments, from one that exhibits unique design to those that are niche in the sense of being rarely seen on the street, or simply not available in mainland China:

Young Chinese consumers told us luxury helps them feel distinct from the people with whom they share their cities. They see luxury as a form of social capital that helps mark them apart; and achieve personal and social goals. That sentiment intensifies towards the younger end of the spectrum; with well over half the sample; and almost 70 percent of post-'90s consumers, telling us they buy luxury to "feel different rather than fit in with society."

Brand remains king when it comes to informing taste across all our surveyed generations, but is relatively less important for younger consumers; for example, brand was the top reason for the last luxury purchase among 68 percent of the post-'90s consumers, compared with 94 percent of the post-'65s/'70s consumers.

# Exhibit 4

Brand is important; but relatively less so among young consumers:

Top reason for last luxury purchase by generation

|Reason|Post-'90s|Post-'80s|Post-'65s/'70s|
|---|---|---|---|
|Brand|68|72|94|
|Design/style| | | |
|Fabric/material| | | |
|Production process| | | |
|Price| | | |

Participants ranked these 5 reasons as contributing factors for their most recent purchase. Note: Figures may not sum to 100%, because of rounding.
