# NF-KB activation by bile

The gene expression alterations listed in Table I from the five different arrays used, have been grouped into four separate groups based on the function of the genes involved. As IL-8 (29) and IkB (30) have previously been suggested to be transcriptional.

# NF-KB reporter system

The ability of DCA to activate NF-KB was investigated using a luciferase reporter system in which the luciferase gene was under the control of NF-KB dependent promoter (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK). In short, the OE33 cells were seeded in triplicate into 6 well tissue culture flasks and the NF-KB luciferase plasmid was transfected into them using the genejammer transfection reagent (Stratagene). Initial experiments validated the transfection using supplied positive control for NF-KB activity. The cells were then either exposed to DCA for varying periods of time (0-4 h) or remained untreated. After exposure, the cells were processed following the manufacturer recommendations to release the luciferase enzyme and the subsequent luciferase expression was quantified with the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega, Southampton, UK). Resulting luminescence was measured using a luminometer (Anthos Labtech Instruments, Salzburg Austria). Fold increases were calculated based on the background luminescence of the untreated cells (untreated cells were set up for each time point analysed). The t-test was used to evaluate differences between the triplicate readings from treated and untreated cells.

This table contains a list of genes whose expression was consistently altered after exposure to DCA. By consistent; we mean that the expression change was evident on both duplicate array experiments (although no real-time PCR data available). In the right hand column is the time point at which the expression change was evident: The arrows in the central column reflect the relative strength of the expression changes.

Membrane array analysis of DCA treated OE33 cells; 24 h post-exposure (a) Cancer pathway arrays were used to study gene expression abnormalities induced by 300 pM DCA relative to untreated OE33 cells. These example arrays show the signal transduction arrays are shown; those hybridized with cDNA from untreated OE33 cells and cDNA from OE33 cells 24 h after DCA exposure. A number of other genes are up-regulated by DCA, particularly evident in the cancer pathway array in (a). These genes (and others) are identified in Table I.
