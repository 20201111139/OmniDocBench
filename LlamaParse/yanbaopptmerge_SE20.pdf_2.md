Assume that an error uncovered during design will cost 1.5 monetary unit to correct: Relative to this cost; the same error uncovered just before testing commences will cost 6.5 units; during testing; 15 units; and after release, between 67 and 100 units.

A number of studies indicate that design activities introduce between 50% and 65% of all errors during the software process. However, formal review techniques have been shown to be up to 75% effective in uncovering design flaws.
