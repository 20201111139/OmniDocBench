(underlined , 5'-TGGGCCATGGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and 3' , 5'-ATCTGGATCCTAGCCCAGGAG-3' , respectively, 6 5'-GTCACCATGGGCTGGTCCGATTCTGCC-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with Ncol, then inserted into the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pNI6 encoding the hexa-histidine-tagged Nlpl with the amino-acid substitution G103D, the mutated nlpl in the chromosomal DNA of Rev3 (spr-1 nlpI3) was amplified by PCR using the primers described above, and the amplified DNA was digested with the Ncol and inserted into the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. To construct pNI7 encoding the truncated and hexa-histidine-tagged NlpI, the fragment containing the truncated nlpl was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5'-TGGGCCATGGAGC CTTTTTTGCG-3' and the reverse primer 5'-GGTCCAT GGGGTCCTGGCCC-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with Ncol, then inserted into the same site of pBAD Myc-His C. pNI8 and pNI9 were constructed in the same way as pNI7 except that 5'-CATCCATGGCCTGGCCCAGG-3' and 5'-CTTCCATGGGGCCCAGGAG-3' respectively; was used as the reverse primer in PCR. To construct pNIIO encoding NlpI, the nlpI in the chromosomal DNA of W3110 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer containing the Ncol site (underlined 5'-TGGGCCAT GGAGCCTTTTTTGCG-3' and the reverse primer containing the BamHI site (underlined 5'-TGGATCCGGCT- CAAAGTAGG-3'. The amplified DNA was digested with Ncol and BamHI and inserted into the same sites of pTrc99A. pNI12, pNI13, and pNI14 were constructed in the same way as pNI10 except that 5'-CCAGGGATCCT- TAGTCCTGGCC-3', 5'-GTCAGGATCCTACTGGCCCAG-
