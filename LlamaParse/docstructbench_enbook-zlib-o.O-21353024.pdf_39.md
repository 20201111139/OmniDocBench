Straight to the manufacturer's website can save you lots of time. Most components have a date code which used to be year and week (like 8634) but these days they can be cryptic batch codes: (In the old days, TTL 74-series logic IC made in 1974, with a 74xx date code could be puzzler!)

If you have few components of one type, look for a code that's the same on all of them that will be the part number; the other codes will be date batch codes of no interest;

Values on passive components are either shown directly (like 47 pF) or as figures or resistor colour code in the form Digit1, Digit2, Multiplier (being the number of zeros) on the component; So SMD inductors often have the value marked in microhenries in this fashion; so 3R3 is 3.3 ÂµH and 333 is 33 mH (33,000 pH) Capacitors may be marked in picofarads tantalum capacitor labelled 227 is 22 x 107 pF = 220 pF.

Some components may have five or six rings of colour code; but the Internet is a great help in decoding these. Most small SMD capacitors are not marked at all, so use your component test equipment to verify them. And get a magnifying glass or a USB microscope (which is what I used to take most of the photos for this article) it makes it much easier to see the tiny writing on small components.

The internet has many resources to assist you search for "IC Manufacturers logos" or "SMD codes" if you need more information: And look up "EIA-96" to decode SMD resistors with what looks like weird 2-number plus 1-letter code:

# Consider the Context

If you're stripping parts off boards, or otherwise know where the component came from, that may give you a clue as to what the part is. An audio board is more likely to have switched-mode PWM IC, whereas a power supply is likely to have op-amps:

# Don't Expect to Identify Everything!

I have a bag of transistors labelled OV8F which have stubbornly refused to be identified. SMD components can be difficult or impossible to identify; as they often have shortened part numbers on them: Even with the considerable resources on the internet, they are not easy:

# Be Selective

I mentioned the boards I got as a kid, with bent-over component leads: I religiously unsoldered all of them: These days I won't touch such components unless they are really special; it's not worth the effort:

Electrolytic capacitors should always be tested; especially large power supply types, and look for domes on the tops - a dead giveaway that they have gone dry or leaky:
