# CHAPTER 29 MAGNETIC FIELDS

We are asked to find the magnetic field due to a simple current distribution, so this example is a typical problem for which the Biot-Savart law is appropriate. We must find the field contribution from a small element of current and then integrate over the current distribution from 0 to 01 as shown in Figure 29.3b.

# Analyse

Let's start by considering a length element ds located a distance r from P. The direction of the magnetic field at point P due to the current in this element is out of the page because ds × f is out of the page. In fact, because all the current elements Ids lie in the plane of the page, they all produce a magnetic field directed out of the page at point P. Therefore, the direction of the magnetic field at point P is out of the page and we need only find the magnitude of the field: We place the origin at O and let point P be along the positive y-axis, with k being a unit vector pointing out of the page.

From the geometry in Figure 29.3a, we can see that the angle between the vectors ds and r is radians.

# Evaluate the cross product in the Biot-Savart law:

ds × i = Ids × ilk = sin(z - oJ)kk = (dx)(dx cos 0)k

Substitute into Equation 29.1:

dB = (dB)k KgL dx cos €k

From the geometry in Figure 29.3a, express r in terms of 0:

cos 0

Notice that tan 0 ~ x/a from the right triangle in Figure 29.3a (the negative sign is necessary because ds is located at a negative value of x) and solve for x:

~ atan 0

# Find the differential dx:

dx = ~ a sec² 0 de

Substitute Equations (2) and (3) into the magnitude of the field from Equation (1):

dB = 4T d0 cos² cos 0 Ko cos 0 d0

Integrate Equation (4) over all length elements on the wire, where the subtending angles range from 0 to 0 as defined in Figure 29.3b:

B = po= cos 0 d0 Ho (sin 0, = sin 02)

Check the dimensions, noting that the quantity in brackets is dimensionless:

[MQ-TT-!] = [MLQ-HQT-'JIL] = [MQ-IT-!]

# (B) Find an expression for the field at a point near a very long current-carrying wire.

Solution: We can use Equation 29.4 to find the magnetic field of any straight current-carrying wire if we know the geometry and hence the angles 0, and 0. If the wire in Figure 29.3b becomes infinitely long, we see that 0 approaches π/2 and 0 approaches π/2 for.
