It is clear that the Asian fintech scene is still maturing overall and still is not quite as developed as other regions, as consolidation is still kicking in: The fact that giant corporations dominate many aspects of fintech already has also contributed to lower M&A volume: However, the fact M&A can rebound speaks to increasing consolidation amid at least the smaller end of players, even if financial giants are holding mammoth sums of growth-stage or late-stage capital.
