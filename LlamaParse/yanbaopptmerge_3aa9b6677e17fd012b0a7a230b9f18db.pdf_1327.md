# Answer Key

k = 50.1 L h-1 mol-1

37. 14.3 d

39. 8.3 x 107 s

41. 0.826 s

43. The reaction is first order: k = 1.0 x 107 L mol min

45. 1.67 x 103 $ 20% remains

47. 252 days

49. (s-1)

|1.81|2.58|
|5.33|2.36|
|4.05|2.47|

moving too slowly to have enough kinetic energy to exceed the activation energy for the reaction, or the orientation of the molecules when they collide may prevent the reaction from occurring:

51. The activation energy is the minimum amount of energy necessary to form the activated complex in a reaction: It is usually expressed as the energy necessary to form one mole of activated complex.

55. After finding k at several different temperatures, a plot of In k versus # gives a straight line with the slope = Ea from which Ea may be determined.

57. (a) 4-times faster (b) 128-times faster

59. 3.9 x 1015 $

61. 43.0 kJ mol

63. 177 kJ mol

65. Ea = 108 kJ

A = 2.0 x 108 s-1

k = 3.2 x 10-10

(b) 1.81 x 108 h or 7.6 x 106 day: (c) Assuming that the reaction is irreversible simplifies the calculation because we do not have to account for any reactant that, having been converted to product, returns to the original state.

67. The A atom has enough energy to react with BC; however, the different angles at which it bounces off of BC without reacting indicate that the orientation of the molecule is an important part of the reaction kinetics and determines whether a reaction will occur:

69. No. In general, for the overall reaction; we cannot predict the effect of changing the concentration without knowing the rate equation: Yes If the reaction is an elementary reaction, then doubling the concentration of A doubles the rate.

71. Rate = k[A][B]; Rate = k[A]
