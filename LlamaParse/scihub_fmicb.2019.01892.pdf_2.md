# Biodegradation of Chlorendic Acid

the groundwater. Based on these measurements, chlorendic acid pollution observed (Figure 1). In March 2013, 24 4-m long hybrid poplar cuttings of the Grimminge cultivar [Populus deltoides (Populus trichocarpa Populus deltoides)] were planted on the field for future phytoremediation purposes. The trees were distributed over a defined rectangular grid of 10 by 35 m, enclosing the area with the highest concentrations of chlorendic acid in the groundwater (> 100 mg L-1) (Figure 1). In 2015, samples for isolation of cultivable fungal strains were collected from soil, rhizosphere and roots of common bent and hybrid poplar: Four soil samples were taken in a 1-m perimeter around observation wells OW175-4 and OW149-4 (Figure 1), from surface soil, Cl, -1.5, and Dietrich and Lamar (1990), and incubated for 7 days at 23°C. The surface sterilized roots were assembled in 15 ml sterile 10 mM MgSO4 and mixed for 10 min using Polytron PRI200 mixer (Kinematica A6).

For fungi isolations, dilutions up to 10-4 of the soil, rhizosphere and endophytic root solutions were plated onto peptone-glucose-acid-agar medium pH 5. After incubation, all fungal mycelia were selected, purified and stored on solid malt extract [2% (w/v)]-peptone [0.3% (w/v)] medium pH 5 at 4°C. For bacteria isolation, dilutions of the soil samples were added to selective minimal medium (Sebastian et al, 1996) supplemented with 25 mg L-1 chlorendic acid as sole carbon source; or with 3 mM glucose in addition to chlorendic acid. Every 10 days, 10 ml of the culture was transferred into 90 ml of fresh medium with a slightly higher concentration of chlorendic acid, ultimately leading to 60 mg L-1 chlorendic acid after 3 months of incubation at 30°C and 120 rpm. At the end of the experiment, chlorendic acid concentrations were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The surviving bacterial strains were purified and stored in a glycerol solution [15% (w/v) glycerol; 0.85% (w/v) NaCl] at -40°C.

# Isolation of Bacteria and Fungi

Soil samples were homogenized and vortexed in sterile 10 mM MgSO4 prior to isolations. Root and rhizosphere samples were vortexed after which the roots were removed from the MgSO4. The resulting soil pellet after centrifugation (15 min, 2700g) constituted the rhizosphere fraction: Poplar roots were surface sterilized by immersing them for 10 min in 0.1% NaClO and supplemented with 0.1% Tween. Following treatment, all roots were rinsed four times in sterile distilled water: The last rinsing solution was plated on 869 medium (Mergeay et al, 1985) to confirm surface sterility by scoring microbial growth after 30 days of incubation at 30°C.

FIGURE: Schematic overview of the sampling site and sampling locations. Soil samples (surface soil; -1, -1.5, and 2 m) and samples of root and rhizosphere of grass were taken in an area of one meter around OW149-4 and OW175-4 (n = 4). Root and rhizosphere samples of poplar were taken of the trees growing closest to the two observation wells, with four repetitions for each tree.
