# Glossary

# Power Function

a function in the form y = ax + b where b is a real number

# Prediction Equation

an equation suggested by the points of a scatter plot used to predict other points

# Pre-image

the graph of an object before a transformation

# Principal Values

the unique solutions of a trigonometric equation if the values of the function are restricted to two adjacent quadrants

# Prisoner Point

If the iterates do not approach infinity for some initial value, that point is called a prisoner point:

# Prisoner Set

the set of initial values for which the iterates of a function do not approach infinity

# Probability

the measure of the chance of a desired outcome happening

# Pure Imaginary Number

the complex number a + bi when a = 0 and b ≠ 0

# Reduced Sample Space

the subset of a sample space that contains only those outcomes that satisfy a given condition

# Reduction Identity

identity that involves adding and subtracting the quadrantal angles, 90°, 180°, and 270° from the angle measure to find equivalent values of a trigonometric function

# Quadrantal Angle

an angle in standard position whose terminal side coincides with one of the axes

# Reference Angle

the acute angle formed by the terminal side of an angle in standard position and the x-axis

# Reflection

linear transformation that flips a figure over a line called the line of symmetry

# Reflection Matrix

a matrix used to reflect an object over a line or plane

# Regression Line

a best-fit line

# Radian

the measure of a central angle whose sides intercept an arc that is the same length as the radius of the circle

# Relation

a set of ordered pairs

# Relative Extremum

point that represents the maximum or minimum for a certain interval

# Relative Maximum

point that represents the maximum for a certain interval

# Relative Minimum

point that represents the minimum for a certain interval

# Resultant of Vectors

the sum of two or more vectors

# Root

a solution of the equation P(x) = 0

# Random Sample

sample in which every member of the population has an equal chance to be selected

# Range

the difference of the greatest and least values in a set of data

# Range of a Relation

the set of all ordinates of the ordered pairs of a relation

# Rate of Change

the derivative of a function when applied to real-world applications

# Rational Equation

an equation that consists of one or more rational expressions

# Rational Function

the quotient of two polynomials in the form f(x) = g(x) where g(x) ≠ 0

# Sample Space

the set of all possible outcomes of an event
