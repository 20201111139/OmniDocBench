The most common histological type was osteosarcoma (n=9: 289) the temporomandibular fossa. The survival rate and survival curve were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method using SPSS for Windows version 10.

Results

Fourteen patients of 32 were making satisfactory progress without local recurrence or metastasis at a mean follow-up period of 8.5 years, ranging from 2 years 3 months to 19 years. Local recurrence was found in 10 cases (319) and metastasis in 1 (349). Among 10 patients with local recurrence, 3 are alive after 6-17 years, and 7 died of their tumors after 5 months to 4 years. Among the 3 patients alive, one (no. 3) was treated by surgery and the other (no. 17) by surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (50 Gy). These two patients are alive without evidence of disease over 3 years and years after salvage treatment. Another patient (no. 5) was treated by preoperative radiation therapy (45 Gy) and surgery for local recurrence. The local recurrence was controlled, but this patient developed distant metastasis to the lung. The 5-year survival rate of patients with local recurrence was 30% (Fig: 1). Among 1 patient with metastases, 9 died.
