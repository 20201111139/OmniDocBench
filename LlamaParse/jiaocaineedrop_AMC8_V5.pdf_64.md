# Chapter 27 Similar Triangles

Solution: A.

As shown in the figure, AABC is similar to ABDC

|AB|BC|
|---|---|
|12|5|
|BC|DC|
|5|DC|
| |12|

DC = 25/12 = 2.12

Example 7. In the following diagram (not necessarily to scale), ZABE LADC.

AE = 6, BC = 2, BE = 3 and CD = 5 AB + DE is equal to

- A. 46/3
- B. 112/3
- C. 13/2
- D. 20
- E. none of these

Solution: A.

We separate two triangles and label each segment as shown in the figure.

We know that AABE AADC

So 5 x + 2 x = 8.

3 x = 40

So y = 3 x 8 = 3

AB + DE = 8 + y = 40 6 = 46

Example 8 A triangle with sides 9, 12 and 15 is similar to another triangle which has longest side 25. The area of the larger triangle is:

- A. 54
- B. 96
- C. 105
- D. 210
- E. 150.
