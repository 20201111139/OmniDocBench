than ameliorate the effects of Perceived Stress On Self-Esteem. similar amplification effect appeared for the analysis of Depression. AIL significant variables. Self-Control failed to be implicated in self-regulation only in the mediation of Anxiety. Additional studies clearly should analyse these two measures further attempts to understand self-regulation. The one significant interaction between these two mediators did suggest that an especially self-insightful self-control might sometimes make unique contributions to self-regulation, but then again, the fact that only one such interaction proved to be significant also implied that any such contributions might be limited. That Integrative Self-Knowledge only sometimes interacts with Self-Control to produce significant effects was also apparent in the previous examination of Iranian religious and spiritual functioning (Ghorbani, Watson, Rezazadeh; & Ode, 2009). Failure of all FFMQ factors to correlate positivity with each other suggested some degree of independence in how at least some aspects of mindfulness function in Iran. Baer et al. (2006) similarly reported no positive correlation between OBS and NONJ in one of their American samples. The negative NONJ correlation with OBS and its weaker and less consistent relationships with the other psychological scales indicated that this factor in particular may need to be the focus of future Iranian research. Specifically, items in this factor may express problematic ideas within the Iranian Muslim cultural context: Two NONJ statements say, for example, 'I tend to evaluate whether my perceptions are right or wrong' (reverse scored) and 'I make judgments about whether my thoughts are good or bad' (reverse scored). Muslim beliefs in, for example, self-control might make it difficult for Iranians to report the mindfulness of NONJ by rejecting such claims. In short, future research should examine the religious implications of NONJ in Iranian Muslims. Integrative Self-Knowledge proved to be an especially noteworthy self-regulatory process. Only this measure was established the measurement invariance of instruments across societies and not just across genders was the case with the FFMQ in the present study. Previous findings have established the measurement invariance of the Integrative Self-Knowledge Scale across Iranian populations.
