All solutions contained HEPES at 5 mM (extracellular solutions) or 10 mM (intracellular solutions) and were adjusted to pH 7.4. Cl was the major anion in all solutions except those containing methane sulfonate (CH2SO4) where Cl was at a concentration of 4 or 10 mM for Kin, Csin, and Kin"/Csin", respectively, and 10 or 20 mM for Baout, Kout?, Kout, and Naout', respectively. Kin-Csin' also contained 0.3 mM GTP and 14 mM phosphocreatine. Concentrations given are in millimolars.

The epithelium labeled with anti-OMP antibody. Labeling is seen in cells shown in Figure 2, C and D, as visualized with differential interference contrast microscopy: Cells used for electrophysiology all had a similar appearance, with clearly identifiable dendrite bearing microvilli. Mouse olfactory neurons were also dissociated for comparative experiments, and a typical cell is shown in Figure 2E at the same magnification. Note that VNO neurons are several times larger than olfactory neurons.

Action potentials in response to current injections were examined by whole-cell patch-clamp recording: The resting potential (Vm) of VNO neurons was 58.3 ± 2.7 mV (mean ± SEM unless otherwise noted; range ~43-70 mV; n = 9; Kin? and Tyrode'$ solutions), which was significantly more depolarized than the resting potential of olfactory neurons measured under similar conditions 81.8 ± 2.1 mV; n = 6). The input resistance of olfactory neurons (2.9 ± 0.8 GΩ; n = 8) was similar to that for VNO neurons (1.1 ± 1.0 GΩ). The capacitance (8.8 ± 0.3 pF; n = 39) was several times larger than that of olfactory neurons (1.8 ± 0.2 pF; n = 7). The responses of a VNO neuron to current injections of ~4 to 4 pA are shown in Figure 3. The response to hyperpolarizing current injections gave a membrane time constant of 15.3 ± 2.2 msec (n = 7). VNO neurons showed a remarkable sensitivity to small current injections, firing repetitive action potentials with injections of 1-2 pA. This sensitivity was also observed in cell-attached patch-clamp recordings; in which we were routinely able to elicit action potentials in response to depolarization of the patch.

VNO neurons fired repetitively with no sign of adaptation.
