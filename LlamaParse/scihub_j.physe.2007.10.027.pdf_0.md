# Abstract

The behavior of the linear magneto-resistivity of the surface-state electrons (SSE) on liquid He exposed to the resonant microwave radiation is experimentally studied in the temperature range corresponding to the crossover between the gas-atom and the ripplon scattering regimes. The variation of resistivity near the microwave resonance is attributed to the heating of SSE induced by the absorption of microwaves. At high temperatures, where gas-atom scattering dominates over ripplon scattering, resistivity decreases. At low temperatures, where ripplons dominate, resistivity is found to increase. The complicated line shape of the resistivity signal observed at intermediate temperatures is attributed to the interplay between the two regimes.

# Introduction

Experimental spectroscopic studies of surface-state electrons (SSE) above liquid helium provide important information about various aspects of this system, such as the subband structure, quantum transport properties, and relaxation phenomena. Such studies have been carried out with electrons above both liquid 4He and liquid He. The recent interest in such studies has been evoked by the theoretical proposal that SSE occupying two lowest Rydberg states can be used as electronic qubits controlled by the microwave (MW) field. The motion of the SSE is confined to a series of two-dimensional subbands: while the motion perpendicular to the surface is restricted to the hydrogen-like quantum Rydberg states, the motion along the surface is free except for the scattering from helium vapor atoms or surface capillary waves (ripplons). For SSE above liquid He, which was used as a substrate in our experiment, the crossover between these two scattering regimes lies at T ~ 0.3 K. Under the typical experimental conditions, the energy difference between the ground and the first excited Rydberg states is much larger than T, therefore almost all electrons occupy the lowest state. The quantum transitions between Rydberg states can be induced by the resonant interaction of SSE with MW radiation. Recently, we showed that in the gas-atom scattering regime the absorption of MWs of frequency is accompanied by a strong heating of SSE caused by the disbalance between the large absorbed power and a very slow energy relaxation rate. An important feature of this process is an efficient channel to transfer the excitation energy absorbed by electrons from the MW field to the thermal energy of in-plane motion. An excited electron decays back to the ground state as a result of the collision with a helium atom or ripplon. In either case, the energy exchange during collision is negligible, and the decayed electron returns to the ground state carrying large kinetic energy, which is quickly redistributed among other electrons owing to the very high electron-electron collision rate (order of 10^10 s-1).
