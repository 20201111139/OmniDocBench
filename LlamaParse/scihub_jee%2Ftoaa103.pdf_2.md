# Fig: General schematic of the third floor of the pilot-scale flour mill used for all experiments.

The black boxes, white circles, and rectangles represent large structural features on the third floor such as support columns, milling equipment, sifters, and large storage bins. The bioassay area positions are numbered 1-10. The location of each aerosol application position denoted as A1, A2, and A3 inside the gray squares. Aerosol application was released from all three locations A1, A2, and A3 (1/3 dose at each position). Source: Scheff et al. (2018), used by permission.

Aerosol was applied at an approximate 45° angle and using a sideways sweeping motion toward the left and right sides of the floorspace. Two additional testing arenas were placed on the first floor of the mill during each aerosol treatment and served as untreated controls. Total aerosol application time was approximately 2-5 min, followed by a 1-h exposure period. After the 1-h exposure, the air ventilation system was turned on for approximately 10 min to remove any residual aerosol particles that may be present in the ambient air.

The next step was to pick up all bioassay arenas that were exposed to the aerosol insecticide treatment and replace them with new bioassay arenas for the next aerosol treatment; which took approximately 5-15 min. The aerosol application position was changed after each treatment and each aerosol application location was repeated twice for each aerosol formulation. Due to logistical constraints of the milling facility (time available for testing) and time required for each aerosol application, the pyrethrin Pyriproxyfen aerosol treatments were conducted first, followed by the pyrethrin methoprene aerosol treatments.

Day of testing had five trials, day 2 had six trials; and day 3 had five trials; for a total of 16 aerosol applications. The T confusum larvae used in the study were from a pesticide-susceptible strain maintained at the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service-Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (USDA-ARS-CGAHR, Manhattan, KS). Tribolium confusum colonies are reared on 95% organic whole-wheat flour and 5% brewer's yeast at 27°C, 60% RH, and 0.24 (L:D) h in an environmental chamber. These colonies have been maintained at the USDA-ARS-CGAHR for more than 30 years.

Testing arenas used in this study were individual 60 x 15 mm (~22 cm²) Petri dishes partially filled with concrete and placed inside larger 150 x 20 mm (~137 cm²) plastic Petri dishes. Concrete dishes were prepared based on Arthur (2015). Briefly, dry powder driveway patching material (Rockite, Hartline Product Co., Inc., Cleveland, OH) was mixed with water to create a thin slurry, poured in the bottom of Petri dishes to a depth of ~0.5 cm, and held at ambient conditions for approximately 24 h. Inside each Petri dish, four concrete arenas were placed. Three of the arenas were used in the current study for residual bioassays at 2, 4, and 6 weeks post-aerosol treatment and contained no diet at the time of exposure to aerosol. The other arena was used as described by Scheff et al. (2018).

These groups of testing arenas were placed at ten different positions on the third floor (Fig: 1). Nine positions also had aerodynamic particle sizer units (APS 3321, TSI Inc, Shoreview, MN) placed to collect data on aerosol particle concentration and size distribution.

# Aerosol Dispersal Patterns

To assess the strength of the effect of the aerosol application, an efficacy value index was created to convert the three morphological states (larvae, pupae, adult) to a single value for comparison (Campbell et al. 2014). The efficacy index ranged from 1, the weakest efficacy response with five adults, to 21, the strongest response with five larvae. All of the index values with the corresponding numbers of adults, pupae, and larvae indicated in brackets were the following:
