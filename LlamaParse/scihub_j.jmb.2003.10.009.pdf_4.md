Proteins, we incubated increasing amounts of HPV 6 and HPV 16 E2 bind preferentially to each protein with a labelled DNA fragment carrying E2 site 4 from the HPV 16 genome and used DNase footprint the resulting complexes. Unlike the BPV E2 DBD, the DBD from the HPV 16 and HPV 18 E2 proteins bind preferentially to sites with an A:T-rich central spacer. Since the concentrations of protein required to obtain a clear footprint are roughly equivalent: Hydroxyl-radical footprinting revealed no significant differences in the DBD-DNA complexes formed by the HPV 16 and HPV DBDs. Circular permutation assays using a set of DNA fragments in which the position of the E2 binding site is varied were used to investigate the effects of each DBD on DNA bending. On binding to DNA, both proteins induce DNA bending and there is no significant difference in the DNA bend angles: 30(+ 1)9 for the HPV 16 DBD and 27(+3)8 for the HPV 6 DBD. Although these data clearly indicate that the DNA bend angle in binding by factor of around tenfold in the case of the HPV 16 DBD and by more than 1000-fold in the case of the HPV DBD. The values for the HPV 16 E2 DBD differ somewhat from the 30-fold degree of preference reported previously for the binding of this protein to E2 sites with these spacer regions. One possibility is that this could be a consequence of the different types of oligonucleotides used in each study. Whilst we have used pairs of short complementary oligonucleotides, the previous study made use of single long oligonucleotides that anneal intramolecularly to form a hairpin of double-stranded DNA. HPV 16 and HPV 6 E2 recognise an extended binding site. An alignment of the four E2 sites present within the HPV 16 LCR produces a consensus sequence that differs from that derived from the.
