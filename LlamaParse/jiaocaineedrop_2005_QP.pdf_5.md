Each spring requires a 0.4 N force to extend or compress it by 1.0 cm:

What steady force is needed to move the pointer in (c)?

What steady acceleration is required to move the pointer in (c)?

The car starts from rest at time t = 0 and travels along a straight road. The accelerometer readings are recorded in Table 14.

|3.00|4.50|
|4.50|7.00|
| |0.00|
