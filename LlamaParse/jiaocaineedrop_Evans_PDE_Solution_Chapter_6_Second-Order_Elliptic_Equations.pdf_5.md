10. Proof: We omit since is standard. For (b), if u attains an interior maximum; then the conclusion follows from the strong maximum principle. If not, then for some z € DU, u(z) > u(z') ∀x € U. Then Hopf's lemma implies Ju > 0, which is a contradiction.

Remark 2: A generalization of this problem to mixed boundary conditions is recorded in Gilbarg-Trudinger, Elliptic PDEs of second order, Problem 3.1.

11. Proof: Define

B[u,v] = ∫U aij ∂iu ∂jv dx for u € H1(U), v € H1(U):

By Exercise 5.17, O(u) € H1(U). Then, for all v € C<infinity>(U); v ≥ 0,

B[O(u),v] = ∫U aij (O(u))i vj dx

∫U aij ∂iu ∂jv dx, (O(u) is bounded since u is bounded)

∫U (∂iu)vi dx < 0 - ∫U (∂iu) ∂iv dx < 0, by convexity of O.

(We don't know whether the product of two H1 functions is weakly differentiable. This is why we do not take O € HX.) Now we complete the proof with the standard density argument C2(U) ∩ C(U) with Lu < 0 in U and u.

12. Proof. Given u € H1(U), u < 0 on U. Since U is compact and v € C(U); v ≥ 0. So w := O € C2(U) ∩ C(U): Brutal computation gives us

∂iv + aijvi ∂jv + aij ∂iu ∂ju + aij ∂iu ∂ju

(Lu + 6iui; cut(-Lvtbvntclu + 0 + aijuiWzi since aij = aji)

Lu uLv 6iWr, aij ∂iui < 0 on {x € U : u > 0} € U

If {x € U : u > 0} is not empty; Weak maximum principle to the operator M with bounded coefficients (since v € C1(U)) will lead to a contradiction that

0 < max W = max W = 0 = 0

{u > 0} d{u > 0}

Hence u < 0 in U.
