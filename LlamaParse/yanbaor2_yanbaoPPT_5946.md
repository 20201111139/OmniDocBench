|Turkey and China, too, had trade-up rates of 20 percent or higher.| | | | | | |
|In some Latin American and African countries, on the other hand, trade-down rates were upward of 20 percent; whereas trade-up rates varied greatly by country: Even among consumers who sought to save money; the preferred methods for doing so weren't necessarily the same from one country to the next.| | | | | | |
|Take many countries; including the United States - 39 percent of those who reported change in buying behavior said they still buy their preferred brands but at stores with lower prices.| | | | | | |
|Compared with 2015, fewer US consumers said they waited for discounts or clipped coupons, suggesting that US bargain hunters, once they've found cheaper retailers, begin to spend more freely at that retailer.| | | | | | |
|This trend underscores the importance of channel strategy for CPG companies: they need to build a strong presence in channels that are perceived as low-priced, such as club stores, discounters, and certain online retailers.| | | | | | |
