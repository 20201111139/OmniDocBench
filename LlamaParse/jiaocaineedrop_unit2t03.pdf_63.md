# The Minister's Black Veil

In fact, Hawthorne's own deep family roots in Puritan Salem haunted the writer throughout his life. Hawthorne's ancestors included a man who had persecuted Quakers and one of the judges who had condemned the Salem "witches" in 1692. Hawthorne himself was keenly aware of issues of sin and guilt.

At the age of thirty-eight, Hawthorne married Sophia Peabody and moved to the Old Manse, the house in Concord, Massachusetts; where writer Ralph Waldo Emerson had lived. However, unable to support his family as a writer, Hawthorne returned to Salem. There he served as Surveyor of the Port but lost the job when the political administration changed. Hawthorne then began writing The Scarlet Letter. This novel, published when Hawthorne was forty-six, was a sensation. He followed up the success with another novel, The House of the Seven Gables.

In 1853, when his friend Franklin Pierce became president of the United States, Hawthorne was awarded the position of U.S. consul to the city of Liverpool, England. He held that position for four years. Then he toured Italy and returned to England to write his last complete novel, The Marble Faun. By 1860, he returned to the United States in ill health, struggling to continue writing, and despondent. Four years later, while traveling with Franklin Pierce, Hawthorne died in his sleep.

*Mr. Hawthorne's distinctive trait is invention, creation; imagination* - Edgar Allan Poe

*What other dungeon is so dark as one's own heart! What jailer so inexorable as one's self?* - Hawthorne
