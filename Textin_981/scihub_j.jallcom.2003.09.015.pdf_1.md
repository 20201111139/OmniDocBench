a Compounds were foundonly in the as-cast samples.

b Data of our investigation.

The formation of solid solution regions for the binary compounds was not revealed, and practically no variation of the lattice parameters of the ternary borides in two- and three-phase samples was observed (Table 2). This fact indi-cates that no homogeneity ranges exist for the ternary com-pounds.

The ternary compounds Ln2NiB10 where Ln-Y,Gd,Tb,Dy,Ho with the Th2NiB10 structure type were reported in [12].We prepared the sample of the composition Er2NiB10to verify the formation of the boride with the same struc-ture in the Er-Ni-B system. But the powder diffraction pattern of this sample contained the lines of three binary compounds (ErB4 +ErB12+NiB),which indicates the ab-

sence of the ternary boride E$Er_{2}NiB_{10}$in the Er-Ni-B system (Table 2).

A compound of the composition ErNiB4 was reported to crystallize with two different structures: ErNiB4 [13] and YCrB4 [14]. This can indicate the existence of polymor-phism for this boride. Taking into account that the boride with the ErNiB4 type structure was found by a single-crystal method, and that the boride with the YCrB4 type structure was found by X-ray powder diffraction, we assumed the high-temperature modification to have the ErNiB4 structure and the low-temperature modification to have the YCrB4structure. The results ofa DTA investigation revealed a tran-sition temperature of 1540 K.

A new compound of the approximate composition ErNi8B2with unknown structure was found. The X-ray powder pattern of this compound differed from the powder patterns of the known ternary borides found in the earlier studied Ln-Ni-B systems. This compound exists only in the as-cast sample and decomposes into the Er2Ni21B6and ErNi4B compounds after annealing. Since the single crystals were not available its structure was not determined.

A further new compound was found in the as-cast samples containing 16.6at.% Er. The X-ray powder pat-tern of this compound was very similar to the pow-der pattern of the Er$Ni_{4}B$boride. The crystal structure of the new Ero.917Ni4.09B boride was determined using an X-ray single-crystal method: space group P6/mmm;a=1.48399nm;c=0.69194nm [15]. This structure is very similar to theYo.915Ni4.12B structure [16].The $Er_{0.917}Ni_{4.09}$B boride decomposes after annealing, and the main phase is the Er$Ni_{4}B$compound.

According to our data, the Er4Ni29B10 boride has the correct composition Er$Ni_{7}B_{3}$:space groupI41/amd;a=
