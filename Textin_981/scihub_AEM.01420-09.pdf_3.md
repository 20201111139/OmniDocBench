dClosest annotated homolog.

(data not shown), consistently with the results for LB, all mu-tant strains showed significantly increased maximum rates of growth (μmaxwt0.14;μmaxAcrtx,0.22;μmax$X_{\Delta crtE}$0.24;and $\mu \max _{\Delta crtY},0.19;P=0.000)$

Cold stress experiments were performed by growing ΔcrtE,ΔcrtX,and ΔcrtY in LB and M9 medium at 10℃ (for results in M9,seeFig.1B). Under these conditions, no significant dif-

ferences in maximum specific growth rates were detected for AcrtY,AcrtE,and ΔcrtX in both LB and M9 compared to those of the wild type (in LB, μmaxwt=0.04,$\mu \max _{\Delta crtX}=0.03,$μmaxΔcrtE=0.03$a\mu \max _{\Delta crrY}=0.04;$ $\in M9,\mu \max _{wt}=$0.01,$\mu \max _{\Delta crtX}=0.0$,μmaxΔcrtE=0.01,and μmaxΔcrtY=0.01).
