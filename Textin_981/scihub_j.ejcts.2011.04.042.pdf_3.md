tertile groups. Plotting survival to the end of the follow-up period (Fig. 2 and Table 3) showed that there was no statistically significant differencein long-term survival between the three tertile groups (log-rankp=0.13).

Of the 104 patients who had received an ambulatory blood-pressure analysis during their follow-up period, 25 (18.4%) were hypertensive and receiving treatment for it. On Kaplan-Meier analysis of freedom from hypertension from the time of hospital discharge to date of last ambulatory blood-pressure measure-ment, there was no difference between the three weight groups (log-rakp=0.39)(Fig.3).

# Secondary outcome measures

Data on postoperative RV function was available in 158 out of 161 patients. Thirty-eight patients (24%) developed RV failure. In the lower tertile group, 18.9% developed postoperative RV failure, in the middle group 24.5% and in the upper tertile group 28.8%; this was not statistically different(p=0..48)(Table 3).

Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier survival plots of the midterm survival according to the weight mismatch tertile group, on the condition of discharge from hos-pital. The plots were not significantly different,log-rankp=0.136.

The mean period of ventilation post transplant was 302.7h (SD 617.8), median 102 h (IQR298). On Spearman's rank correl-ation, this was not associated with thedonor/recipient weight ratio (Fig. 3) (p=-0.12p=0.14)..Even when excluding the 11 patients who had been intubated for more than 100 h, there was no association(p=-.p=.38)(Fig.4).

The mean period of ITU stay was 448 h (SD 749.2), median 184 h (IQR374). On Spearman's rank correlation, this was also not related to the weight ratio(p=-00p=058)(Fig5).Again,if the six patients who were in the ITU for more than 2000 h were excluded, there was still no association(p&lt;.1p=.98).

# Extreme mismatch subgroup

There were nine patients in whom the donor-recipient weight mismatch was 3 or greater (5.5%). By the end of the follow-up period, there was only 11% (1/9) mortality, compared with 18.2% (23/126) for those with a ratioof&lt;3(p=0.76

At the end of the follow-up period, of the six patients with 'extreme' mismatch who had been investigated with ambulatory blood-presure measurement, only one was being treated for
