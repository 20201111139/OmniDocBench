# 20.2 Defect Amplification and Removal

### ·Defect Amplification Model

<!-- Defects Detection Errors from Previous step Errors passed through Percent Amplified errors 1:x Errors passed Efficiency To next step Newly generated errors Development step  -->

· Assume that an error uncovered during design will cost 1.5monetary unit to correct. Relative to this cost, the same error uncovered just before testing commences will cost 6.5 units;during testing, 15 units; and after release, between 67 and 100units.

· A number of studies indicate that design activities introduce between 50% - 65% of all errors during the software process.However, formal review technique have been shown to be up to 75% effective in uncovering design flaws.
