# Apparel and accessories

Retailers in apparel and accessories recorded the best bottom-line performance among the four product sectors, with a composite net profit margin

of 8.3 percent in FY2018, 2.3 percentage points more than the previous year. The sector also achieved the highest return on assets (9.4 percent), 1.6 percentage points higher than in FY2017. Retailers in this sector were the most international,generating 38.5 percent ofrevenues from foreign operations,in 30 countries on average. However, the sector's contribution to the total revenue of the Top 250 global retailers was just 9.7percent,with companies recording average revenue of US&#36;11.8billion.

Some of the key factors that have led to the sector's positive momentum, amid store closures of various department stores,are the greater focus on omni-channel presence,a steady increase in e-commerce websites, and greater emphasis on improvements in in-store shopping experience for customers.TJX, LVMH, Inditex, Macy's, and H&M were the biggest revenue contributors in the sector in FY2018, each with retail revenue above US&#36;20 billion.Richemont and Zalando achieved the highest rates of revenue growth. Overall revenue growth for thesector was 4.7 percent on a sales-weighted currency adjusted composite basis which was higher than the Top 250(4.1 percent).

# Fast-moving consumer goods

With the largest number of companies(136)in the list,the fast-moving consumer goods(FMCG)

product sector is the main contributor to the Top 250 metrics,with retailers generating US&#36;23.2 billion on average in FY2018.The focus of FMCG retailers is largely on their home country operations, with companies generating only 21.5 percent of their sales from foreign countries and having a presence in just 6.2 countries on average. The FMCG sector recorded the lowest profitability among the product sectors, with a composite net profit margin of 2.0 percent.

Across all geographic markets, FMCG retailers witnessed tough competition with ongoing price wars and increasing costs due to wage rises. Retailers in the US,despite rising manufacturing costs, slashed prices of food and grocery items due to intensified competition between high-volume retailers Costco,Walmart,Kroger and Target.37 In efforts to compete with Amazon, FMCG retailers have been employing strategies such as greater focus on e-commerce, buy-online-pickupin-store,cashier-less stores, opening more convenience stores,voice-enabled shopping, and doorstep delvery. Retailers in this sector contributed 66.5 percent of the total revenue of the Top 250, and Reliance, Pan Pacific, BiM Birleşik, Chedraui, A101,and Maxima Grupe all achieved revenue growth in excess of 20percent in FY2018.
