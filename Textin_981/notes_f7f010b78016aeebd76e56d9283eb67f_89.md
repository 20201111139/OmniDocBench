3．改进阅读方式

（1）预测：培养学生依据文章标题、插图以及相关的背景知识和社会生活经验，对文章大致内容预测以及可能涉及到的词汇，然后阅读文章第一段，并对预测进行验证，纠正，同时抓住主题句、关键词，从而更好地从整体上去理解和把握文章中心。

（2）略读：指导学生快速浏览全文，须会文章大意，辨析文体，掌握篇章结构，进而抓住文章中心。

（3）查读：在浏览全文基础上进行查渎，以回答个别事实细节性的问题。有些细节性的问题不能直接在短文中找到答案，要进行综合、归纳、转换才能获得，也就是要在直接可获得的事实和细节的基础上经过综合、归纳，转换，间接获得所需的事实和细节。它通常涉及数据、时间、人称、代词的指代、动作的行为的关联，动作行为者与承受者、地点和空间、表态方式、因果、条件、内涵与外延等。如：
