55. Students were asked to 56. The nursing club held a 57. A clothing store needs to bring their favorite fruit to bake sale to raise money order new inventory. It has class. 95% of the fruits and sold brownies and three different types of consisted of banana, apple, chocolate chip cookies. hats for sale: straw hats, and oranges. If oranges They priced the brownies beanies, and cowboy hats. were twice as popular as at \( \$ 1 \) and the chocolate The straw hat is priced at bananas, and apples were chip cookies at \( \$ {0.75} \) . They \$13.99, the beanie at \$7.99, 5% less popular than raised \$700 and sold 850 and the cowboy hat at bananas, what are the items. How many brownies \$14.49. If 100 hats were percentages of each and how many cookies sold this past quarter, individual fruit? were sold? \$1,119 was taken in by sales, and the amount of beanies sold was 10 more than cowboy hats, how many of each should the clothing store order to replace those already sold?

58. Anna, Percy, and Morgan 59. Three roommates shared a 60. A farmer constructed a weigh a combined 370 lb. If package of 12 ice cream chicken coop out of Morgan weighs \( {20}\mathrm{{lb}} \) more bars, but no one chicken wire, wood, and than Percy, and Anna remembers who ate how plywood. The chicken wire weighs 1.5 times as much many. If Micah ate twice as cost \$2 per square foot, the as Percy, how much does many ice cream bars as wood \$10 per square foot, each person weigh? Joe, and Albert ate three and the plywood \( \$ 5 \) per less than Micah, how many square foot. The farmer ice cream bars did each spent a total of \$51, and roommate eat? the total amount of materials used was \( {14}{\mathrm{{ft}}}^{2} \) . He used \( 3{\mathrm{{ft}}}^{2} \) more chicken wire than plywood. How much of each material in did the farmer use?

61. Jay has lemon, orange, and pomegranate trees in his backyard. An orange weighs \( 8\mathrm{{oz}} \) , a lemon \( 5\mathrm{{oz}} \) , and a pomegranate \( {11}\mathrm{{oz}} \) . Jay picked 142 pieces of fruit weighing a total of 70 lb, 10 oz. He picked 15.5 times more oranges than pomegranates. How many of each fruit did Jay pick?
