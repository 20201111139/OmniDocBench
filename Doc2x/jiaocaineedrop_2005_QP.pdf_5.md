The car starts from rest at time \( t = 0 \) and travels along a straight road. The accelerometer readings are recorded in Table 14.

<table><tr><td>Time / s</td><td>Acceleration / \( \mathrm{m}/{\mathrm{s}}^{2} \)</td></tr><tr><td>0.00 – 3.00</td><td>11.00</td></tr><tr><td>3.00 – 4.50</td><td>7.00</td></tr><tr><td>4.50 – 7.00</td><td>0.00</td></tr></table>
