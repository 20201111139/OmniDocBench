## 2. (18%) On FA and Regular Languages

Say whether each of the following languages is regular or not regular? Prove your answers.

(a) \( {L}_{1} = \left\{  {w \mid  w \in  \{ 0,1{\} }^{ * }}\right. \) and \( w \) has an equal number of 0 s and 1 s \( \} \) .

(b) \( {L}_{2} = \left\{  {w \mid  w \in  \{ 0,1{\} }^{ * }}\right. \) and \( w \) has an equal number of 01s and \( \left. {{10}\mathrm{\;s}}\right\} \) .

3. (20%) On PDA and Context-Free Languages

Let \( {L}_{3} = \left\{  {{wc}{a}^{m}{b}^{n} \mid  w \in  \{ a, b{\} }^{ * }}\right. \) , where \( \left. {w = {w}^{R}\text{, and}m, n \in  \mathbb{N}, n \leq  m \leq  {2n}}\right\} \) .

(a) Give a context-free grammar for the language \( {L}_{3} \) .

(b) Design a PDA \( M = \left( {K,\sum ,\Gamma ,\Delta , s, F}\right) \) accepting the language \( {L}_{3} \) .

Solution: (a)

(b) The PDA \( M = \left( {K,\sum ,\Gamma ,\Delta , s, F}\right) \) is defined below:
