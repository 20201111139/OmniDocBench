contents of \( \mathrm{{Mn}} \) and \( \mathrm{{Si}} \) , which is consistent with the literature. \( {}^{\left\lbrack  {16},{30}\right\rbrack  } \) After being SHTed for 8 hours, almost the entire amount of \( {\mathrm{{Al}}}_{2}\mathrm{{Cu}} \) is dissolved into the \( \mathrm{{Al}} \) matrix as shown in Figure 2(b). It is also interesting to note that the Chinese script \( \alpha \) -Fe phase becomes unstable and is transformed into a small amount of short intermetallic platelets, leading to the fragmentation of the \( \alpha \) -Fe.

The chemical compositions of the iron-rich interme-tallics in Alloy B in the as-cast and SHTed (for 8 hours) conditions measured by SEM-EDS are shown in Table II. It can be found that higher Al contents are detected in the \( \alpha \) -Fe and STed \( \beta \) -Fe after SHT than the corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from the liquid. This can be attributed to the partial contribution of the surrounding \( \mathrm{{Al}} \) matrix due to the small sizes of the fragmented \( \alpha \) -Fe and STed \( \beta \) -Fe particles after SHT. Compared with the as-cast condition, it can be found that the iron content in \( \alpha \) -Fe is reduced after SHT for 8 hours. As shown in Figure 2(c), however, the EBSD results with a mean angular deviation (MAD) of 0.452 , lower than 0.7 which is considered to be critical for an accurate solution, \( {}^{\left\lbrack  {31}\right\rbrack  } \) indicate that this phase is still the \( \alpha \) -Fe (body-centered cubic with \( a, b \) , and \( c \) as \( {1.265}{\mathrm{\;{nm}}}^{\left\lbrack  {11}\right\rbrack  } \) ). Moreover, the platelet-like intermetallic phase formed during the SHT has a similar chemical composition to the \( \beta \) -Fe obtained in the as-cast condition (Table II) and thus is termed as solid-state-transformed \( \beta \) -Fe (STed \( \beta \) -Fe) to distinguish it from the \( \beta \) -Fe directly precipitated from liquid metal during solidification. The formation of the STed \( \beta \) -Fe is further confirmed a low MAD value of 0.258 as measured by EBSD (Figure 2(d)), The STed \( \beta \) -Fe is most likely to have the same crystal structure as the solidified \( \beta \) -Fe (tetragonal with a and b of \( {0.634}\mathrm{\;{nm}} \) and c of \( {1.488}{\mathrm{\;{nm}}}^{\left\lbrack  {11}\right\rbrack  } \) ) due to their similar diffraction patterns. However, the STed \( \beta \) -Fe has lower \( \mathrm{{Cu}} \) content than the \( \beta \) -Fe (Table II), and the replacement of the \( \mathrm{{Cu}} \) by \( \mathrm{{Al}} \)
