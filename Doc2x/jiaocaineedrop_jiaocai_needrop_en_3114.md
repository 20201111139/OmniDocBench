十、文段表达 (共 15 分)

75. One possible version:

Nowadays, most middle school students have pocket money every month, and we did a survey in Class 1, Grade 9.

As the result shows, among the thirty students taking part in the survey, most of them often buy snacks; about a half spend their pocket money on books, and a few save some of it.

However, things on me are quite different. I usually spend most of the money buying good and educational books which I think make me more knowledgeable. Only a small part is spent on snacks as most of the snacks are in fact unhealthy for us. And I save the rest against a rainy day.

It is true that we have more and more pocket money now. Whether we can make good use of it really counts, because it is partly influencing the way we are growing up. 在线学习网址: www.Jinghua.com 客服热线:400-650-7766(9:00-21:00 everyday) 版权所有 北京天地精华教育科技有限公司
