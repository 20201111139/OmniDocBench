## Let's talk

Mum: Sarah, Sam, come here, please.

Sarah: What's wrong?

Mum: Your father is ill. He should see a doctor this morning, so we can't go to the zoo today.

Sam: Oh, no!

Mum: Don't be sad. We can go next time.

Sam: How does Dad feel now?

Mum: Not well. Let's go to the hospital.

How does Sam feel? What should he do?

Act with your friends.

Your friends need some help. Call them and give your suggestions.
