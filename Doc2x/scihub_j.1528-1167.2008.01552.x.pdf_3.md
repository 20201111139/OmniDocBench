'Maximum protection, 62.5%.

AED, antiepileptic drug; MES, maximal electroshock; TD \( {}_{50} \) , the dose eliciting evidence of minimal neurotoxicity in 50% of animals; Cl, confidence interval; ED \( {}_{50} \) , the dose of drug required to produce the desired end point in 50% of animals; and PI, protective index (ratio of TD \( {}_{50} \) to ED \( {}_{50} \) ).

## Pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure test

Rank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal administration of AEDs in the pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital \( > \) rufinamide \( >  > \) valproate \( = \) ethosuximide \( >  > \) phenytoin (Table 1). Phenytoin was ineffective up to a dose of \( {300}\mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}} \) . In slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant potency in this test with oral administration in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide > ethosuximide >> valproate >>> phenytoin (Table 2).

Oral rufinamide \( \left( { \geq  1,{000}\mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}}}\right) \) and phenytoin (800 \( \mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}} \) ) did not inhibit pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticonvulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.

## Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced seizure tests in mice

Intraperitoneal rufinamide was effective at nontoxic doses in the bicuculline and picrotoxin clonic seizure tests \( \left( {{\mathrm{{ED}}}_{50} \sim  {50} - {75}\mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}}}\right) \) and showed partial protection from strychnine-induced tonic seizures (37.5% protection; Table 1). Overall, the general order of potency in these chemically induced seizure tests was phenobarbital \( \geq \) rufinamide \( >  > \) valproate \( = \) ethosuximide \( > \) pheny-toin (Table 1). In the strychnine-induced tonic seizure test, phenytoin had the lowest \( {\mathrm{{ED}}}_{50} \) value, suggesting the greatest potency. However, it is important to note that \( {50}\% \) protection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Pheny-toin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced clonic seizures in mice.

## Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice

The median toxic dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide \( \left( {\mathrm{{TD}}}_{50}\right) \) in the rotorod test of behavioral impairment was \( {500} - 1,{000}\mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}} \) . The \( {\mathrm{{TD}}}_{50} \) for rufinamide was higher than that for comparator AEDs (Table 1), indicating a lower toxicity. Higher doses of rufinamide were not assessed due the low \( {\mathrm{{ED}}}_{50} \) values and high protective index (>40).

Neurological side effects of very high-dose intraperitoneal rufinamide \( (1,{000}\mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}},\mathrm{n} = 2;{\mathrm{{ED}}}_{50}{15} - {100} \) \( \mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}} \) ) included decreased motor activity, ataxia, muscle relaxation, decreased respiration, and death (one animal died; the other appeared normal). Higher doses of the comparator drugs induced increased side effects \( \left( {2 \times  {\mathrm{{TD}}}_{50}}\right) \) and resulted in death (all animals) in \( 3 - {24}\mathrm{\;h}\left( {4 \times  {\mathrm{{TD}}}_{50}}\right) \) . The safety ratio for rufinamide in mice \( \left( {{\mathrm{{TD}}}_{3}/{\mathrm{{ED}}}_{97} > {19.2}}\right. \) [intraperitoneal] and >23.8 [oral]) was consistently greater than for phenytoin, phenobarbital, and valproate (Table 4).

The median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required to produce loss of righting reflex in mice \( \left( {\mathrm{{HD}}}_{50}\right) \) was \( > {500} \) and \( < 1,{000}\mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}} \) (Table 5). Rufinamide had a numerically greater \( {\mathrm{{HD}}}_{50} \) value than phenytoin or phenobarbital \( \left( {\mathrm{{HD}}}_{50}\right. \) values of 178 and \( {135}\mathrm{{mg}}/\mathrm{{kg}} \) , respectively). Rufinamide, ethosuximide, and valproate had comparable
