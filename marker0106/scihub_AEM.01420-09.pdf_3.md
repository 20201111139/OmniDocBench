a NCBI clusters of orthologous groups (COG) of proteins.

6 Cronobacter sakazakii ES5 BAC 9E10 for mutations within the pigment operon (accession no. AM384990.1).

6 NCBI assembly ATCC BAA-894 C. sakazakii complete genome for mutations outside pigment operon (accession no. CP000783.1),

a Closest annotated homolog.

(data not shown), consistently with the results for LB, all mutant strains showed significantly increased maximum rates of growth (umaxwt, 0.14; umaxAcrtx, 0.22; umaxAcrtE, 0.24; and umax Acrty, 0.19; P = 0.000).

Cold stress experiments were performed by growing AcrtE, AcrtX, and AcrtY in LB and M9 medium at 10â„ƒ (for results in M9, see Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, no significant dif-

ferences in maximum specific growth rates were detected for AcrtY, AcrtE, and AcrtX in both LB and M9 compared to those of the wild type (in LB, pmaxwt = 0.04, umaxAcrtx = 0.03, umax AcrtE = 0.03, and umax crty = 0.04; in M9, umaxwt = 0.01, umaxAcrtx = 0.01, umaxAcrtE = 0.01, and umaxAcrty = 0.01).
