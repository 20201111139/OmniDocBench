contents of Mn and Si, which is consistent with the literature.[16,30] After being SHTed for 8 hours, almost the entire amount of Al2Cu is dissolved into the Al matrix as shown in Figure 2(b). It is also interesting to note that the Chinese script x-Fe phase becomes unstable and is transformed into a small amount of short intermetallic platelets, leading to the fragmentation of the a-Fe.

The chemical compositions of the iron-rich intermetallics in Alloy B in the as-cast and SHTed (for 8 hours) conditions measured by SEM-EDS are shown in Table II. It can be found that higher Al contents are detected in the x-Fe and STed ß-Fe after SHT than the corresponding iron-rich phases solidified directly from the liquid. This can be attributed to the partial contribution of the surrounding Al matrix due to the small sizes of the fragmented x-Fe and STed ß-Fe particles after SHT. Compared with the as-cast condition, it can be found that the iron content in a-Fe is reduced after SHT for 8 hours. As shown in Figure 2(c), however, the EBSD results with a mean angular deviation (MAD) of 0.452, lower than 0.7 which is considered to be critical for an accurate solution, 311 indicate that this phase is still the x-Fe (body-centered cubic with a, b, and c as 1.265 nm [11). Moreover, the platelet-like intermetallic phase formed during the SHT has a similar chemical composition to the ß-Fe obtained in the as-cast condition (Table II) and thus is termed as solid-state-transformed ß-Fe (STed ß-Fe) to distinguish it from the ß-Fe directly precipitated from liquid metal during solidification. The formation of the STed ß-Fe is further confirmed a low MAD value of 0.258 as measured by EBSD (Figure 2(d)), The STed ß-Fe is most likely to have the same crystal structure as the solidified ß-Fe (tetragonal with a and b of 0.634 nm and c of 1.488 nm [1]) due to their similar diffraction patterns. However, the STed ß-Fe has lower Cu content than the B-Fe (Table II), and the replacement of the Cu by Al
