a Compounds were found only in the as-cast samples.

b Data of our investigation.

The formation of solid solution regions for the binary compounds was not revealed, and practically no variation of the lattice parameters of the ternary borides in two- and three-phase samples was observed (Table 2). This fact indicates that no homogeneity ranges exist for the ternary compounds.

The ternary compounds Ln2NiB10 where Ln-Y, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho with the Th2NiB10 structure type were reported in [12]. We prepared the sample of the composition Er2NiB10 to verify the formation of the boride with the same structure in the Er-Ni-B system. But the powder diffraction pattern of this sample contained the lines of three binary compounds (ErB4 + ErB12 + NiB), which indicates the absence of the ternary boride Er2NiB10 in the Er-Ni-B system (Table 2).

A compound of the composition ErNiB4 was reported to crystallize with two different structures: ErNiB4 [13] and YCrB4 [14]. This can indicate the existence of polymorphism for this boride. Taking into account that the boride with the ErNiB4 type structure was found by a single-crystal method, and that the boride with the YCrB4 type structure was found by X-ray powder diffraction, we assumed the high-temperature modification to have the ErNiB4 structure and the low-temperature modification to have the YCrB4 structure. The results of a DTA investigation revealed a transition temperature of 1540 K. A new compound of the approximate composition ErNi8B2 with unknown structure was found. The X-ray powder pattern of this compound differed from the powder patterns of the known ternary borides found in the earlier studied Ln-Ni-B systems. This compound exists only in the as-cast sample and decomposes into the Er2Ni21B6 and ErNi4B compounds after annealing. Since the single crystals were not available its structure was not determined.

A further new compound was found in the as-cast samples containing 16.6 at. % Er. The X-ray powder pattern of this compound was very similar to the powder pattern of the ErNi4B boride. The crystal structure of the new Ero.917Ni4.09B boride was determined using an X-ray single-crystal method: space group P6/mmm; a = 1.48399 nm; c = 0.69194 nm [15]. This structure is very similar to the Y0.915Ni4.12B structure [16]. The Ero.917Ni4.09B boride decomposes after annealing, and the main phase is the ErNi4B compound.

According to our data, the Er4Ni29B10 boride has the correct composition ErNi7B3: space group I41/amd; a =
