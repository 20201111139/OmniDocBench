## · Interface Design Principles - I

- o Anticipation-A WebApp should be designed so that it anticipates the use's next move.
- o Communication-The interface should communicate the status of any activity initiated by the user
- o Consistency-The use of navigation controls, menus, icons, and aesthetics (e.g., color, shape, layout)
- Controlled autonomy—The interface should facilitate user movement ● throughout the WebApp, but it should do so in a manner that enforces navigation conventions that have been established for the application.
- Efficiency-The design of the WebApp and its interface should . optimize the user's work efficiency, not the efficiency of the Web engineer who designs and builds it or the client-server environment that executes it.
