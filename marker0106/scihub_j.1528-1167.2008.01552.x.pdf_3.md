## Pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure test

Rank order for relative potencies of the intraperitoneal administration of AEDs in the pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic seizure test in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide >> valproate = ethosuximide >> phenytoin (Table 1). Phenytoin was ineffective up to a dose of 300 mg/kg. In slight contrast, the rank order for relative anticonvulsant potency in this test with oral administration in mice was phenobarbital > rufinamide > ethosuximide >> valproate >>> phenytoin (Table 2).

Oral rufinamide (≥1,000 mg/kg) and phenytoin (800 mg/kg) did not inhibit pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in rats (Table 3). Phenobarbital achieved the best anticonvulsive potency of the remaining three AEDs.

# Bicuculline-, picrotoxin-, and strychnine-induced seizure tests in mice

Intraperitoneal rufinamide was effective at nontoxic doses in the bicuculline and picrotoxin clonic seizure tests (ED50 ~50-75 mg/kg) and showed partial protection from strychnine-induced tonic seizures (37.5% protection; Table 1). Overall, the general order of potency in these chemically induced seizure tests was phenobarbital > rufinamide >> valproate = ethosuximide > phenytoin (Table 1). In the strychnine-induced tonic seizure test, phenytoin had the lowest ED50 value, suggesting the greatest potency. However, it is important to note that 50% protection was the maximum achieved with this AED. Phenytoin failed to provide protection against bicuculline- and

## Evaluation of behavioral toxicity in mice

The median toxic dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide (TD50) in the rotorod test of behavioral impairment was 500-1,000 mg/kg. The TD50 for rufinamide was higher than that for comparator AEDs (Table 1), indicating a lower toxicity. Higher doses of rufinamide were not assessed due the low ED50 values and high protective index (>40).

Neurological side effects of very high-dose intraperitoneal rufinamide (1,000 mg/kg, n = 2; ED50 15-100 mg/kg) included decreased motor activity, ataxia, muscle relaxation, decreased respiration, and death (one animal died; the other appeared normal). Higher doses of the comparator drugs induced increased side effects (2 x TD50) and resulted in death (all animals) in 3-24 h (4 x TDso). The safety ratio for rufinamide in mice (TD3/ED97 >19.2 [intraperitoneal] and >23.8 [oral]) was consistently greater than for phenytoin, phenobarbital, and valproate (Table 4).

The median dose of intraperitoneal rufinamide required to produce loss of righting reflex in mice (HD50) was >500 and <1,000 mg/kg (Table 5). Rufinamide had a numerically greater HD50 value than phenytoin or phenobarbital (HD50 values of 178 and 135 mg/kg, respectively). Rufinamide, ethosuximide, and valproate had comparable
